A survey of respondents' behaviors, habits, and expectations when using different communication channels was conducted, with particular emphasis on chatbots, their advantages and disadvantages in relation to other communication channels, in total sum of 60 survey respondents. The results showed that the greatest advantage of using chatbots in the marketing service was when providing simple, fast obtained information, but also showed respondents' fear of chatbots giving them the wrong information. Organizations should consider using chatbots, especially if challenges in communication with customers are reality, but also if they intend to keep up with the growing number of consumers' lifestyle.",

This also applies to marketing, which is subject to virtualization related both to its concept and instruments, as well as marketing activities. The purpose of the paper is to show the role of artificial intelligence and human talent in decision making in the field of marketing in an enterprise. Design/methodology/approach: Critical literature review; the research procedure that is based on the review of the literature is focused on formulating the answers to the following questions: - What factors determine the effective implementation of artificial intelligence as a technology supporting decision-making processes in the sphere of marketing in enterprises? - What are the identified models of application of artificial intelligence and human talent in making decisions in enterprises? Findings: The use of the opportunities offered by artificial intelligence in supporting marketing decisions brings many benefits, but it also requires overcoming mental and cultural barriers. It should be emphasized that relying on artificial intelligence in decision-making processes does not mean eliminating people, especially the talented ones, because it is the employee who can revise the decision-making criteria or state that the algorithm on the basis of which decisions are made in the company is outdated. Research limitations/implications: Empirical verification of the proposed model would allow for identifying the role performed by talented employees and algorithms in decision-making processes in the era of development of innovative IT solutions along with determination of the hierarchy of factors stimulating these processes. Originality/value: Proposing a model of determinants and types of solutions that allow for effectively combining human resources described as talent and artificial intelligence in making decisions in the field of marketing in enterprises is the result of the considerations provided in the paper.",

To develop the AIM framework, we bring together and curate a wide range of relevant literatures including real-life examples and cases, and then understand how these literatures contribute to the framework in this research topic. We explain the AIM framework from the interdisciplinary perspective, which is an important role of both the artificial intelligence and marketing academia. The AIM framework includes three main components, including the pre-processor, the main processor, and the memory storage. The main processor, which is the key component, uses AI to process structured data processed by pre-processor in order to make real-time decisions and reasonings. The AI approach is characterized by its hypothetical abilities, learning paradigms, and operation modes with human. The strategic use of the developed AIM framework based on the literature to enhance customer relationships, including customer trust, satisfaction, commitment, engagement, and loyalty, is presented. Finally, future potential investigations are presented to drive forward this interdisciplinary research topic.",

   "content": "Killer applications, or killer apps, are technology applications that profoundly change the way any society thinks, works, and functions. This paper explores Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a killer app, with specific application to marketing. Specifically, this paper employs the lens of technology history to explore the relationship between marketing and AI. Using Kranzberg's six laws of technology, this paper sheds light on all manner of innovations, how technologies have shaped and impacted society, and how marketers can respond to this. This inquiry offers two main contributions: First, it suggests a number of implications for marketing practice and scholars, derived from each of Kranzberg's laws. These suggestions are intended to guide marketing practice when implementing or using AI. In addition, this article offers a number of research directions that might be fruitful and important areas for investigation in future scholarly work regarding technology's impact among marketing scholars.",

   "content": "With the progress of Internet technology and the rapid development of artificial intelligence, intelligent technology products rapidly grow up. However, influenced by many factors, the marketing status of this kind of products in recent years is not ideal, for example, big data leakage and other issues. Especially in recent years, because of the greater market competition, the marketing of intelligent technology brands is facing greater problems. The purpose of this study is to analyze the current situation of brand marketing of intelligent technology under the background of artificial intelligence and propose the optimization strategy of brand marketing of such products, so as to promote the continuous improvement of brand marketing effect of intelligent technology. Based on artificial intelligence and the concept of brand marketing, through intelligent technology brand marketing investigation and experiment, the intelligent technology brand marketing status and current problems are analyzed; from marketing, product type, and product price, three angle analysis of the factors that influence the marketing and Internet marketing, product quality, product pricing, and product development is put forward from the four angles of specific strategy of optimization of smart technology products' brand marketing. The experimental results show that the year-on-year growth rate of smart technology brand turnover is decreasing at the present stage. The increase rate of the turnover in 2019 is only 3.24%, far lower than that in 2015, and the growth rate of the turnover decreases by about 33%. At present, there are many problems in the marketing strategy of intelligent technology brands, and the optimization of marketing strategy is an urgent problem to be solved.",

   "content": "The authors develop a three-stage framework for strategic marketing planning, incorporating multiple artificial intelligence (AI) benefits: mechanical AI for automating repetitive marketing functions and activities, thinking AI for processing data to arrive at decisions, and feeling AI for analyzing interactions and human emotions. This framework lays out the ways that AI can be used for marketing research, strategy (segmentation, targeting, and positioning, STP), and actions. At the marketing research stage, mechanical AI can be used for data collection, thinking AI for market analysis, and feeling AI for customer understanding. At the marketing strategy (STP) stage, mechanical AI can be used for segmentation (segment recognition), thinking AI for targeting (segment recommendation), and feeling AI for positioning (segment resonance). At the marketing action stage, mechanical AI can be used for standardization, thinking AI for personalization, and feeling AI for relationalization. We apply this framework to various areas of marketing, organized by marketing 4Ps/4Cs, to illustrate the strategic use of AI.",

Despite relevance to marketing theory and practice, deepfakes-and the opportunities for benefit or deviance they provide-are little understood or discussed. This article introduces deepfakes to the marketing literature and proposes a typology, conceptual framework, and associated research agenda, underpinned by theorizing based on balanced centricity, to guide the future investigation of deepfakes in marketing scholarship. The article makes an argument for balance (i.e., situations where all stakeholders benefit), and it is hoped that this article may provide a foundation for future research and application of deepfakes as a new hope for marketing.",

   "content": "In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has become an emerging trend in different fields: science, business, medicine, automotive and education. AI has also reached marketing. The aim of the paper is to research how deeply AI is applied in marketing and what implications there are for marketing practitioners. Authors stated two research questions which areas of AI are used in marketing and what implications AI delivers for marketing managers. To answer those questions, the authors conducted research on secondary data with AI examples used for marketing purpose. The analysis of gathered examples shows that AI is widely introduced into the marketing field, though the applications are at the operational level. This may be the effect of careful implementation of the new technology, still at the level of experimenting with it. The uncertainty of the outcome of AI implementation may affect the caution in putting these innovations into practice as well. Gathered examples proved that AI influences all aspects of marketing mix impacting both consumer value delivery as well as the marketing organization and management. The paper delivers implications for business, especially ideas about implementing AI into marketing, designing innovations and the ideas on how to incorporate new skills into marketing team required by the new technology.",

Building from not only extant research but also extensive interactions with practice, the authors propose a multidimensional framework for understanding the impact of AI involving intelligence levels, task types, and whether AI is embedded in a robot. Prior research typically addresses a subset of these dimensions; this paper integrates all three into a single framework. Next, the authors propose a research agenda that addresses not only how marketing strategies and customer behaviors will change in the future, but also highlights important policy questions relating to privacy, bias and ethics. Finally, the authors suggest AI will be more effective if it augments (rather than replaces) human managers.",

   "content": "Purpose This paper aims to explore how chief executive officers (CEOs) and C-suite marketing executives (chief marketing officers [CMOs], chief customer officers [CCOs], chief branding officers [CBOs], etc.) talk about marketing concepts to better understand how marketers can more effectively articulate their value and increase their strategic influence within the firm. Design/methodology/approach Artificial intelligence-enabled computerized text analysis was used to identify and weight keywords from 266 CEO and C-suite marketing executive interviews. Custom marketing concept dictionaries were used to gauge overall marketing focus. Findings The analysis revealed opportunities for C-suite marketers to align specific marketing concepts with that of CEOs for increased strategic influence. Comparisons between C-suite marketing roles showed that CMOs are more focused on marketing strategy than specialized C-suite marketing positions, such as CCO and CBO. This points to a potential decrease in strategic impact for marketing executives dependent on the specialization of their position. Originality/value This paper represents the first use of artificial intelligence-enabled computerized text analysis to explore and compare executive speech acts to help increase marketing's influence in the firm. It is also the first to explore differences in marketing concept use between C-suite marketing roles.",

   "content": "Artificial Intelligence is one of today's most outstanding research fields and can be easily used in marketing activities. Multimedia platforms (social networks, news, photos, video, infographics, newsletters, podcasts, blogs, e-books, how-to-guides, etc.) today no longer serve only for communication between users or users and companies, but also for companies to collect and classify data of paramount importance for directing all forms of business. Data from the systems that register user's behaviour on multimedia platforms enables deep segmentation by applying models based on artificial intelligence, while also creating a personal profile of such behaviour. This allows multichannel systems in marketing communications to reach users with personalized message. Multimedia platforms are also suitable for transmission of affective visual concepts through image content. Latest relevant literature findings show that basic functions, values and the nature of marketing will not change, but multimedia platforms as well as communication channels in synergy with a large amount of data will make marketing more focused, and communication and buying more atomized. The main purpose of this paper, drawing on the wealth of available literature, is to give a theoretical insight into this new and fast developing area where the newest technology merges with the existing business practices. Also, some exciting applications of the AI into the real-world marketing practices has been briefly presented. In the conclusion of the paper the evaluation of such technological advances in marketing field and future predictions have been provided.",

Marketing is one of the business streams witnessing this transformation on a very intense scale. Contemporary marketing has begun to experiment with modern, cutting-edge technologies, such as AI, deploying them in mainstream operations to ensure accelerated success. This article explores the use of AI in marketing as an emergent stream of research. Based on inferences from earlier studies, the study categorizes marketing into five distinct functional themes-integrated digital marketing, content marketing, experiential marketing, marketing operations, and market research-and 19 sub-functional themes (activity levers). Across the chosen themes and sub-themes, the study further dovetails into and identifies 170 featured use cases of the extant literature, where AI is leveraged by marketing in delivering superior quality outcomes and experiences. By way of a systematic literature review (SLR), the article evaluates 57 qualifying publications in the context of AI-powered marketing and qualitatively and quantitatively ranks them based on their coverage, impact, relevance, and contributed guidance, and elucidates the findings across various sectors, research contexts, and scenarios. The study discusses the practitioner and academic research implications and proposes a future research agenda to study the continuous transformation fostered by accelerated adoption of AI across the marketing landscape.",

The sales graph experienced a dip by over 86.23% when it was revealed to the customer that the interface is with the machine, not humans and reduced the duration of the call substantially. The paper shows that Indians do not believe Artificial Intelligence and still prefer human interface as they do not trust machines over human emotions. The effectiveness of AI drastically reduces despite its superiority over humans in various aspects.

   "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled digital marketing is revolutionizing the way organizations create content for campaigns, generate leads, reduce customer acquisition costs, manage customer experiences, market themselves to prospective employees, and convert their reachable consumer base via social media. Real-world examples of organizations who are using AI in digital marketing abound. For example, Red Balloon and Harley Davidson used AI to automate their digital advertising campaigns. However, we are early in the process of both the practical application of AI by firms broadly and by their marketing functions in particular. One could argue that we are even earlier in the research process of conceptualizing, theorizing, and researching the use and impact of AI. Importantly, as with most technologies of significant potential, the application of AI in marketing engenders not just practical considerations but ethical questions as well. The ability of AI to automate activities, that in the past people did, also raises the issue of whether marketing professionals will embrace AI as a means to free them from more mundane tasks to spend time on higher value activities, or will they view AI as a threat to their employment? Given the nascent nature of research on AI at this point, the full capabilities and limitations of AI in marketing are unknown. This special edition takes an important step in illuminating both what we know and what we yet need to research.",

With the deluge of data and the increase in processing power, businesses are now facing the challenge of how to deploy AI that generates business value. In this direction, there is still nascent research on how AI can be leveraged in for B2B operations, and particularly marketing. To address this gap, this study draws on the dynamic capabilities view of the firm and specifically on the micro-foundations approach and builds on three selected case studies of large organizations in Norway that use AI for B2B marketing purposes. The study identifies a number of AI-specific micro-foundations of dynamic capabilities, essentially highlighting how organizations can use AI to manage B2B marketing operations in dynamic and uncertain environments. This study also identified several key cross-cutting elements emerging from the data, demonstrating how some key concepts are inter-related and how they affect overall business value.",

   "content": "This study presents a novel taxonomy of short message service campaigns, for the purpose of building an intelligent marketing system. The main issue of mass marketing is that one size does not fit everybody. In other words, it is challenging to meet different consumer needs. With the help of artificial intelligence, marketers can be supported to overcome some of these challenges. This study uses a mixed methods approach where design science and grounded theory is used to produce a short message service campaign taxonomy for a future intelligent marketing system. Data collection consisted of 386 previously active campaigns used over 33 months to build the taxonomy. An experimental study was conducted to test the effectiveness of the proposed taxonomy. The experiments involved automatic generation of campaign messages. The validity of these campaign messages, and hence the proposed taxonomy, was ascertained by analysing the messages within a business context. The study concludes that the system, intertwined with the taxonomy, performs comparably to a regular campaign. Another proof of concept is that the business context deemed the generated campaign texts to be both semantically and syntactically similar to run them in active campaigns as experiments.",

The artificial intelligence interacts in the form of a virtual personal assistant, such as Amazon's Alexa. Companies are currently creating voice applications for smart speakers that allow consumers to use the personal assistant to perform tasks, such as acquiring information and ordering products. This is the dawn of a new type of interaction between brands and consumers, a new touchpoint. Brands need to catch the vision and create content for this new technology, content that is useful in the buying process. The purpose of this study is to determine what types of marketing messages people find acceptable on smart speakers. Based on the findings, a cognitive message strategy is effective with smart speakers. The paper presents three types of executional frameworks that are best suited for the design of a cognitive message: authoritative, testimonial, and slice-of-life. The overriding requirement for marketing on smart speakers is that the message must provide value to the listener.",

This research aims to identify the extent of the contribution of AI in preparing the marketing plan. The author noted that intended to know how e-marketing companies could use AI techniques in situation analysis, analyze competitors' strategies, strategic goals, preparing marketing strategies, preparing an estimated marketing budget, and control a marketing plan. Systematization of the scientific background and approaches on preparing a marketing plan for e-marketing organizations indicates that many companies, especially small companies, marketing their products via the Internet, cannot develop a successful marketing plan. In turn, it could be solved through the use of AI techniques. The study was conducted on a group of companies that market their products via the Internet in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. To gain the research goal, this study was carried out in the following logical sequence: 1) developing the stratified sample by collecting statistical information for 141 company in a variety of fields; 2) analyzing the data using SPSS; 3) predicting how AI could be used in preparing the marketing plan; 4) identifying the arrangement of the steps for preparing the marketing plan in terms of the ability of AI techniques. The methodological tools of the study were methods of the multiple regression analysis and the Friedman test. The study empirically confirms and theoretically proves that AI contributes significantly in developing marketing plans through its great contribution to environmental analysis and analysis of competitors' strategies and setting marketing goals. Besides, AI contributes to preparing the budget and appreciating the marketing plan, to its evaluation and control. The author mentioned that AI provides understanding and selecting target markets and sectors, targeting customers, and preparing appropriate marketing mix strategies for each market sector. Therefore, the study provides recommendations to online organizations to use AI in preparing their marketing plan because of its great ability to contribute to this.",

In the absence of any existing relevant hypotheses, this paper attempts to build theory using a case study approach and qualitative analysis of interview narratives. Findings Despite the human attributes ascribed to these products, participants were principally concerned with their purpose, efficiency and the degree of trust which they felt could be accorded to the product. Anthropomorphism emerged as significant with participants making some associations with common archetypes traditionally exploited in marketing and this suggests a possible means of enhancing consumer trust in AI products. Originality/value Little research has been conducted on the marketing of AI and this study presents a timely identification of some potentially significant issues. As AI is intended to mimic some aspects of human intelligence, the role of the archetype in creating a personality to enhance trust may prove crucial in securing consumer confidence.",

Importantly, audience numbers on opening weekend are highly affected by marketing activity before the release, and these numbers determine how many screens will be allocated to the movie. Therefore, distributors need to predict audience numbers on opening weekend and develop marketing strategies in order to gain a competitive advantage over other films being screened at the same time. However, as distributors make predictions based on their experiences and intuitions, it is difficult to quantify the reliability of predicted values and deliver the correct marketing strategy. In this study, we propose a model that predicts audience numbers on the opening Saturday using market research data obtained through online and offline surveys to help distributors develop better marketing strategies.

   "content": "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to review literature about the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in strategic situations and identify the research that is needed in the area of applying AI to strategic marketing decisions. Design/methodology/approach The approach was to carry out a literature review and to consult with marketing experts who were invited to contribute to the paper. Findings There is little research into applying AI to strategic marketing decision-making. This research is needed, as the frontier of AI application to decision-making is moving in many management areas from operational to strategic. Given the competitive nature of such decisions and the insights from applying AI to defence and similar areas, it is time to focus on applying AI to strategic marketing decisions. Research limitations/implications The application of AI to strategic marketing decision-making is known to be taking place, but as it is commercially sensitive, data is not available to the authors. Practical implications There are strong implications for all businesses, particularly large businesses in competitive industries, where failure to deploy AI in the face of competition from firms, who have deployed AI to improve their decision-making could be dangerous. Social implications The public sector is a very important marketing decision maker. Although in most cases it does not operate competitively, it must make decisions about making different services available to different citizens and identify the risks of not providing services to certain citizens; so, this paper is relevant to the public sector. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is one of the first papers to probe deployment of AI in strategic marketing decision-making.",

   "content": "Purpose: The aim of the article is an attempt to answer the question of customers' knowledge on AI and its application in marketing. Design/methodology/approach: In-depth interviews with 203 people (residents of Lodzkie and Mazowieckie voivodships) who visited a science center at least once were conducted in 2019. In the sampling, the snowball effect was used. The problems concerning artificial intelligence were a part of bigger research (other matters were focused on omnichannel environment and wearables). Findings: The research results showed that respondents understand the term artificial intelligence (AI) in a highly intuitive manner, which often remains in conflict with the classical meaning of the term. The perception of scope and usage of AI is based mainly on stereotypes and representations sourced in mass media. The main advantages of AI noticed by respondents were time savings and offers better adjusted to their needs, while the major disadvantages were the limitation of choice in terms of preferred products (for example, during online shopping) and threats of data leaks. Respondents were supporters of usage of AI in marketing in the scope limited by law. Research limitations/implications: The usage of non-probabilistic sampling, a relatively small sample and the usage of qualitative analysis methods were major limitations of the conducted research. As the research resorted only to the people with previous experiences with science centers' offer, the possibility to generalize research results was restricted (due to the specific profile of those entities' customers). Originality/value: The presented paper is a part of the research area related to the usage of new technologies in cultural institutions, especially science centers' marketing activities. The research was aimed at diagnosing how respondents understand the term artificial intelligence and what their attitude towards the usage of AI in marketing is. The cognitive value of the paper might also be seen in the focus on a relatively narrow and homogenous group of respondents (science centers' customers). The reason is relatively low popularity of research in that group and their bigger knowledge and technology acceptance (as compared to the general public).",

Direct marketing can increase marketing efficiency by directing the efforts specifically towards the right customer.Even though the popularity of direct marketing campaigns is increasing over time, the selection of contacts is becoming more rigorous, and it has become essential to reduce the number of contacts to do, due to economic factors as well as consumer privacy issues. Direct marketing analytics requires algorithms that are efficient and scalable. In this study we explore the use ofSupport Vector Data Description(SVDD) to facilitate the selection of contacts. Support Vector based classification methods have been proved to be successful in a variety of applications; but they tend to take more computing time when dealing with large scale data. Here we apply a novel low complexity SVDD method for direct marketing. Experiments on a real-world dataset related to a direct marketing campaign have demonstrated that SVDD based methods can provide promising accuracies when compared to other approaches. Also, the accuracy achieved by the proposed low complexity method is comparable with theclassical SVDD and it has huge advantage over it in terms of the execution time.",

   "content": "Groundwater is the only source of water for the development of oasis agriculture. However, due to the lack of scientific groundwater management and excessive exploitation, there are also varying degrees of problems in irrigation technology and crop planting structures, which have caused the oasis's groundwater level to decline year by year, water quality deterioration, soil salinization, desertification, and vegetation degradation. With serious consequences, these problems continue to threaten the ecological protection and agricultural development of the oasis. This article focuses on the hydrological and ecological problems of oasis caused by over-exploitation of groundwater resources. Taking oasis as the research goal of this paper, combined with the ecological idea of coordinating the development and utilization of water resources and ecological environment protection to achieve sustainable development, this paper studies the data mining technology from the perspective of data mining, and focuses on the application and popularization of neural network in the marketing evaluation of the telecommunications industry. This article will introduce the development status and application fields of data mining technology and neural network technology, discuss the current status and future development trends of marketing plan evaluation methods in China's electronic communications industry, and explore the current domestic telecommunications industry's use of manual statistics and evaluation of marketing policies The author will use data mining, artificial intelligence, complex network analysis and other research methods to break through the boundaries of traditional user trend research. Based on various index data in corporate marketing and feedback data after marketing, the evaluation model based on BP algorithm is further developed, and the telecom marketing evaluation model makes up for the shortcomings of manual analysis.",

   "content": "Purpose Few well-documented studies have explained the importance of researching firms' marketing analytics capability (FMAC). In spite of its significance, there is scant attention to conceptualising and empirically investigating FMAC and its consequences in a data-driven business context. Thus, this study aims to develop and test a conceptual model that relates FMAC and its repercussions in the data-rich business environment. Design/methodology/approach This study analysed the data from 250 managers amongst large and medium-sized manufacturing and service-intensive firms. Furthermore, this research performed an empirical study by using operationalised questionnaire survey method to verify the hypotheses and reach its theoretical and managerial implications. Structural equation modelling with maximum-likelihood estimation method was applied to verify the validity of the proposed research model. Findings Multivariate analysis results show that FMAC significantly influences firms' competitive marketing performance (FCMP) with the presence of holistic marketing decision-making (HMDM) as a mediator. Moreover, adoption of artificial intelligence (AAI) enhances the relationship of FMAC-HMDM and FMAC-FCMP linkages. Practical implications This study analyses how FMAC can enhance FCMP and contributes to resource-based views and technological capability theories. From a managerial perspective, guidelines are provided for marketers to adopt advance technologies, such as AI, to optimise FMAC and HMDM to achieve competitive marketing performance. Originality/value Believing that how to be competitive in marketing performance under data-rich-environment, this research is the first to use the data of a firm manager to facilitate the understanding of FMAC, which provides a new direction for improving marketing performance. In addition, HMDM and AAI are also proposed for firms to optimise FCMP.",

This is due to their advance technology, high idealistic marketing plan, population and high internet usage. Currently there are many concerns being raised by individuals in the marking sector and also the marketing experts, on the future growth of digital marketing. Nevertheless, in Malaysia the business idealistic marketing plans arc very broad and mostly using traditional approach towards promoting and selling their product. Thus, the technology advancement in the Malaysia is currently in a moderate stage and not as advance as the Europe or foreign countries. Besides, the technology advancement in Malaysia, the knowledge on following the right process flow in digital marketing is very low. Furthermore, a developing country usually follow the trends in other developed foreign countries rather than establishing new trends. The suggestion of new technology with better marketing strategy other than digital marketing in the Europe or foreign countries, eventually reduce the use of digital marketing strategies. However, the aim is to ensure that the digital marketing strategies are used in Malaysia for a longer term without any extinction. Therefore, this paper proposes a strategy to deliver a correct and resourceful training with the precise process flow or steps in using digital marketing. The strategy enables users to adapt the current technology of digital marketing for betterment and innovation especially implementing Artificial Intelligence (AI) into Digital Marketing for more security and technology advancement.",

With Artificial Intelligence's help to make conversational interactivity more intuitive to existing and potential customers visiting the websites, managers can notch up the return on marketing investments. This motivated us to study empirically and develop the MarkBot framework, a chatter robot on the management design principles. The framework uses an Artificial Intelligence application to respond to a website visitor's browse through the product catalog. Neural network (NN) architectures are known to achieve remarkable performances in synthetic text predictions. We use a long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM) to predict the user's responses through a chatbot in the current work. The proposed framework reduces the lead time for the firms to adopt MarkBot. We empirically prove using user-generated content on social media platforms like Twitter in responses and queries to digital campaigns on the same product. With new businesses failing to venture into the space of hosting a chatbot owing to no historical data or existing firms yet to host a chatbot, the proposed MarkBot fuelled by user-generated content can have a substantial managerial implication. The management frameworks used to theorize the MarkBot also make it a theoretical contribution for future Information Systems scholars to conceptualize in the marketing field.",

   "content": "This research note investigates how consumers' individual differences are associated with their attitude towards trip advice that has been curated by artificial intelligence (AI). Individual difference factors (anthropomorphic tendency, need for cognition, disillusionment toward marketing, life satisfaction) and variables such as smart phone usage were correlated with attitude towards AI-curated reviews (A(AICR)). A survey of 212 individuals from Taizhou, China found that anthropomorphic tendency, need for cognition, and smart phone usage were positively associated with A(AICR). When controlling for the effect of need for cognition and smart phone usage, the effect of anthropomorphism on attitudes was still robust. Disillusionment toward marketing and life satisfaction were not associated with A(AICR). The results contribute to the tourism literature by showing the effect of anthropomorphism on A(AICR). Tourism practitioners who wish to inspire consumers with AI-curated destination reviews should target consumers with a high anthropomorphic tendency.",

In this research, we seek to discover how the potential users of this AI-based software (owners and employees from digital agencies based in France, Italy and Romania, as well as freelancers from these countries, with expertise in SMM) perceive the capabilities that we offer, as a way to differentiate our technological solution from other available in the market. We propose a causal model to find out which expected capabilities of the future AI-based software can explain potential users' intention to test and use this innovative technological solution for SMM, based on integer valued regression models. With this purpose, R software is used to analyze the data provided by the respondents. We identify different causal configurations of upcoming capabilities of the AI-based software, classified in three categories (audience, image and sentiment analysis), and will trigger potential users' intention to test and use the software, based on an fsQCA approach.",

Food marketers need to adjust to this new situation and integrate proven interdisciplinary theoretical frameworks, as these approaches can be aligned to address this situation. Due to the limitations of traditional-marketing-theory, the field has not captured this gap by addressing emerging trends effectively. We address these new developments by introducing the design of the Weltanschauung model, which is based on marketing within the dimensions of designing a firm-consumer-relationship based on cocreation and coevolution in the design and meaning search spaces.

Association Rules Mining provides powerful data mining techniques for identifying associations and co-occurrences in large databases.

As Artificial Intelligence (AI) more and more finds its way to marketing, it entails fundamental changes in the skills-set required by marketers. For MBA, AI provides important ways to improve both the outcomes of the market basket analysis and the performance of the analysis process. In this study we demonstrate the effects of AI on MBA by our proposed new MBA model where results of computational intelligence are used in data preprocessing, in market segmentation and in finding market trends. We show with point-of-sale (POS) data of a small, local retailer that our proposed Abo algorithm MBA model increases mining performance/intelligence and extract important marketing insights to assess both demand dynamics and product popularity trends. Additionally, the results show how, as related to the 80/20 percent rule, 78% of revenue is derived 16% of the product assortment.",

The reason is that digital experiences have become an important issue in the hotel industry. At the same time, an increasing number of high-end hotels have developed sophisticated multisensory strategies to generate multisensory brand experiences of their guests during their stay. To answer our research question, we carried out two studies, i.e. interviews and an internet survey. Our findings show that both hotel managers and guests seem to believe that the application of IoTs may stimulate guests' sensory experiences and increase their satisfaction and loyalty. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that the different digital tools available on the market need to be carefully analyzed (e.g. SWOT) in view of their potential impact on customers' sensory experiences prior to their implementation.

Design/methodology/approach This is a theoretical contribution, relying on discursive analysis. Findings Before an era of full and all-pervasive automation arrives, there will be a decades-long transitional stage of heteromation. In the heteromation, machines and humans will have to coexist adaptively. The spheres of production and consumption will be affected radically by the patterns of people-machine interactions, including coexistence, cooperation, adaptation, adjustments and conflicts. As the connective tissue between the spheres of production and consumption, marketing would also undergo major transformations in the age of heteromation. Originality/value Using the concept of heteromation, this paper presents hitherto unexplored and critical implications of potentially epochal transformations for marketing.",

While the extant literature extensively covers AI applications that generally benefit businesses and customers, there is scant research on AI deployments that exacerbate problems for financially vulnerable customers. These customers have limited access to financial systems, services or technologies. To rectify this research deficit, this paper describes the challenges confronting businesses as they attempt to integrate AI into the digital marketing of their financial services. Ultimately, Al-enabled digital marketing is not as simple as collecting big data and using analytical algorithms; the technology may not always help businesses target their customers more effectively. This paper examines the relationships between AI, digital marketing, and financial services in relation to vulnerable customers, highlighting key implications in the collection, processing, and delivery of information, as well as the importance of human connection for optimal customer experience and engagement with financial services providers. Understanding ethical implications, as well as data and modelling challenges, is necessary for the successful deployment of AI. This study provides a theoretical framework to financial services providers, AI developers, marketers, policymakers, and academics, aiding the understanding of the precarious conditions facing vulnerable customers, and the ways in which they can more effectively be reached.",

We review possible architectures for VPSAs, privacy implications and ethical considerations, especially in view of the European Union's General Data Protection Directive (GDPR). There is a concern that compliance with GDPR will limit the data companies can collect, thus interfering with marketing activities. Because VPSAs are owned by users and are expected to keep the user's data private, they might be the technological solution to reducing the GDPR compliance burden for online sellers, while providing some or more of the marketing information sellers traditionally developed.",

   "content": "Edge Artificial Intelligence (Edge AI) is a crucial aspect of the current and futuristic digital marketing Internet of Things (IoT) / Internet of Everything (IoE) environment. Consumers often provide data to marketers which is used to enhance services and provide a personalized customer experience (CX). However, use, storage and processing of data has been a key concern. Edge computing can enhance security and privacy which has been said to raise the current state of the art in these areas. For example, when certain processing of data can be done local to where requested, security and privacy can be enhanced. However, Edge AI in such an environment can be prone to its own security and privacy considerations, especially in the digital marketing context where personal data is involved. An ongoing challenge is maintaining security in such context and meeting various legal privacy requirements as they themselves continue to evolve, and many of which are not entirely clear from the technical perspective. This paper navigates some key security and privacy issues for Edge AI in IoT/IoE digital marketing environments along with some possible mitigations.",

This commentary discusses recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, and how these are influencing marketers, consumers and society by either leading to a dystopian (black magic), utopian (white magic) or 'dualopian' future (grey magic). We argue that the net effect is squarely in the grey and that marketers have a unique power to leverage AI and robotics developments for good. The commentary concludes with 24 research questions forming an agenda for future research under three streams: marketing power, understanding the bias and ethics revisited.",

   "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) agents driven by machine learning algorithms are rapidly transforming the business world, generating heightened interest from researchers. In this paper, we review and call for marketing research to leverage machine learning methods. We provide an overview of common machine learning tasks and methods, and compare them with statistical and econometric methods that marketing researchers traditionally use. We argue that machine learning methods can process large-scale and unstructured data, and have flexible model structures that yield strong predictive performance. Meanwhile, such methods may lack model transparency and interpretability. We discuss salient AI-driven industry trends and practices, and review the still nascent academic marketing literature which uses machine learning methods. More importantly, we present a unified conceptual framework and a multi-faceted research agenda. From five key aspects of empirical marketing research: method, data, usage, issue, and theory, we propose a number of research priorities, including extending machine learning methods and using them as core components in marketing research, using the methods to extract insights from large-scale unstructured, tracking, and network data, using them in transparent fashions for descriptive, causal, and prescriptive analyses, using them to map out customer purchase journeys and develop decision-support capabilities, and connecting the methods to human insights and marketing theories. Opportunities abound for machine learning methods in marketing, and we hope our multi-faceted research agenda will inspire more work in this exciting area. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Whilst a great potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in the service industries is predicted, the concrete influence of AI on customer experiences remains little understood. Drawing upon the service-dominant (SD) logic as a theoretical lens and a scenario technique approach, this study explores the impact of artificial intelligence as an operant resource on event experiences. The findings offer a conceptualisation of three distinct future scenarios for the year 2026 that map out a spectrum of experiences from value co-creation to value co-destruction of events. The paper makes a theoretical contribution in that it bridges marketing, technology and experience literature, and zooms in on AI as a non-human actor of future experience life ecosystems. A practical guideline for event planners is offered on how to implement AI across each touch point of the events ecosystem.",

Digital marketing strategies are formulated by the marketing teams in order to increase the traffic on their e-commerce sites, thereby boosting the sales of the products. With the massive amount of data available from the cloud, which were conventionally made with a high degree of intuition based on decision makers' knowledge and experience, can now be supported with the application of artificial intelligence techniques. This paper introduces a novel approach in applying the fuzzy association rule mining approach and the fuzzy logic technique, for discovering the factors influencing the pricing decision of products launched in e-commerce retail site, and in formulating flexible, dynamic pricing strategies for each product launched in an e-commerce site. A pricing decision support system for B2B e-commerce retail businesses, namely Smart-Quo, is developed and implemented in a Hong Kong-based B2B e-commerce retail company. A six-month pilot run reveals a significant improvement in terms of the efficiency and effectiveness in making pricing decisions on each product. The case study demonstrates the feasibility and potential benefits of applying artificial intelligence techniques in marketing management in today's digital age.",

This research proposes a framework for modeling and forecasting export sales using Genetic Programming, which is an artificial intelligence technique derived from the model of biological evolution. Analyzing an empirical case of an export company, an export sales forecasting model is suggested. Moreover, a sales forecast for a period of six weeks is conducted, the output of which is compared with the real sales data. Finally, a variable sensitivity analysis is presented for the causal forecasting model.",

   "content": "Omni-channel marketing is an enhanced cross-channel business model involving shared data that allows enterprises to enhance and facilitate customer experience. Omni-channel opportunities shape retail business and shopper behaviours by coordinating data across all channel platforms while enabling their simultaneous use. Artificial intelligence (AI) has played an increasingly critical role in marketing analysis. With the proper training, AI can predict consumer preferences and provide recommendations based on historical data to achieve precision marketing in e-commerce. At present, however, the existent chatbots on many product-ordering platforms lack AI refinement, resulting in the need to ask customers multiple questions before generating a reliable suggestion, yet an effective way to incorporate AI in an omni-channel platform has remained vague. Hence, the aim of this study was to develop an omni-channel chatbot that incorporates iOS, Android, and web components. The chatbot was designed to achieve personalised service and precision marketing using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). A shared kitchen case study demonstrates the advantages of the proposed method, which is transferable to other consumer applications such as clothing selection or personalised services. The number of food offerings and the quality of image classifiers set the research limitations, pointing toward the direction of future research.",

Thus, this study aims to explore the antecedents (e.g. compatibility, perceived ease of use, performance expectancy and social influence) and consequences (e.g. chatbot usage intention and customer engagement) of chatbot initial trust. Design/methodology/approach A sample of 184 responses was collected in Lebanon using a questionnaire and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) by AMOS 24. Findings The results revealed that except for performance expectancy, all the other three factors (compatibility, perceived ease of use and social influence) significantly boost customers' initial trust toward chatbots. Further, initial trust in chatbots enhances the intention to use chatbots and encourages customer engagement. Research limitations/implications The study provides insights into some variables influencing initial chatbot trust. Future studies could extend the model by adding other variables (e.g. customer experience and attitude), in addition to exploring the dark side of artificial intelligence chatbots. Practical implications This study suggests key insights for marketing managers on how to build chatbot initial trust, which, in turn, will lead to an increase in customers' interactions with the brand. Originality/value The current study marks substantial contributions to the artificial intelligence marketing literature by proposing and testing a novel conceptual model that examines for the first time the factors that impact chatbot initial trust and the key outcomes of the latter.",

   "content": "Race is integral to the functioning and ideological underpinnings of marketplace actions yet remains undertheorized in marketing. To understand and transform the insidious ways in which race operates, the authors examine its impact in marketplaces and how these effects are shaped by intersecting forms of systemic oppression. They introduce critical race theory (CRT) to the marketing community as a useful framework for understanding consumers, consumption, and contemporary marketplaces. They outline critical theory traditions as utilized in marketing and specify the particular role of CRT as a lens through which scholars can understand marketplace dynamics. The authors delineate key CRT tenets and how they may shape the way scholars conduct research, teach, and influence practice in the marketing discipline. To clearly highlight CRT's overall potential as a robust analytical tool in marketplace studies, the authors elaborate on the application of artificial intelligence to consumption markets. This analysis demonstrates how CRT can support an enhanced understanding of the role of race in markets and lead to a more equitable version of the marketplace than what currently exists. Beyond mere procedural modifications, applying CRT to marketplace studies mandates a paradigm shift in how marketplace equity is understood and practiced.",

   "content": "Undoubtedly, customer relationship management has gained its importance through the statement that acquiring a new customer is several times more costly than retaining and selling additional products to existing customers. Consequently, marketing practitioners are currently often focusing on retaining customers for as long as possible. However, recent findings in relationship marketing literature have shown that large differences exist within the group of long-life customers in terms of spending and spending evolution. Therefore, this paper focuses on introducing a measure of a customer's future spending evolution that might improve relationship marketing decision making. In this study, from a marketing point of view, we focus on predicting whether a newly acquired customer will increase or decrease his/her future spending from initial purchase information. This is essentially a classification task. The main contribution of this study lies in comparing and evaluating several Bayesian network classifiers with statistical and other artificial intelligence techniques for the purpose of classifying customers in the binary classification problem at hand. Certain Bayesian network classifiers have been recently proposed in the artificial intelligence literature as probabilistic white-box classifiers which allow to give a clear insight into the relationships between the variables of the domain under study. We discuss and evaluate several types of Bayesian network classifiers and their corresponding structure learning algorithms. We contribute to the literature by providing experimental evidence that: (1) Bayesian network classifiers offer an interesting and viable alternative for our customer lifecycle slope estimation problem; (2) the Markov Blanket concept allows for a natural form of attribute selection that was very effective for the application at hand; (3) the sign of the slope can be predicted with a powerful and parsimonious general, unrestricted Bayesian network classifier; (4) a set of three variables measuring the volume of initial purchases and the degree to which customers originally buy in different categories, are powerful predictors for estimating the sign of the slope, and might therefore provide desirable additional information for relationship marketing decision making.

   "content": "Firms are increasingly turning towards new-age technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), the internet of things (IoT), blockchain, and drones, among others, to assist in interacting with their customers. Further, with the prominence of personalization and customer engagement as the go-to customer management strategies, it is essential for firms to understand how to integrate new-age technologies into their existing practices to aid seamlessly in the generation of actionable insights. Towards this end, this study proposes an organizing framework to understand how firms can use digital analytics, within the changing technology landscape, to generate consumer insights. The proposed framework begins by recognizing the forces that are external to the firm then lead to the generation of specific capabilities by the firm. Further, the firms capabilities can lead to the generation of insights for decision-making that can be data-driven and/or analytics-driven. Finally, the proposed framework identifies the creation of value-based outcomes for firms and customers resulting from the insights generated. Additionally, we identify moderators that influence: (a) the impact of external forces on the development of firm capabilities, and (b) the creation of insights and subsequent firm outcomes. This study also identifies questions for future research that combines the inclusion of new-age technologies, generation of strategic insights, and the achievement of established firm outcomes.

   "content": "The recent digital development forced many market leaders to adopt advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to facilitate the transition from rigid processes to more flexible, outcome-driven approaches. The use of AI presents numerous benefits. First of all, the AI technology helps enable the analysis of unstructured data from a variety of sources across social media channels. Also, AI allows companies not only to automate certain processes but also to reconfigure them to complement and, more importantly, augment the skills and expertise of employees. The new era of artificial intelligence-systems gather information, analyze, recommend, plan and more importantly, learn. This paper presents an innovative approach to recruitment. According to recent studies, business intelligence and analytics showed to be the most crucial area that AI can deliver results. We analyze how software companies are more prone to integrate AI applications in marketing because of the new market trend - digital marketing. Services companies, on the other hand, are more interested in the use of AI in human resources. Our case study applies Sentiment Analysis (SA) techniques to improve the recruitment processes aiming to increase the efficiency of internship campaigns by ensuring a better match between the candidates' professional skills and the hiring company fields of activity. We demonstrate that AI can improve the recruitment process and assist in hiring the right persons. Thus, the HR staff has the opportunity to select the internship candidates based on their skills and determine the right position where abilities of an individual candidate are most needed. This novel approach not only increases the company productivity but also motivates candidates to improve their skills.",

   "content": "Business forecasting refers to the methods and strategies used to predict business trends, such as sales, expenditures, and profits. The purpose of business forecasting is to create better plans based on these informed predictions. Many businesses consider that it is imperative to obtain information about the future to ensure future organizational success. Enhancing forecasting progression can allow managers to make better decisions. Hence, in this study, artificial intelligence-assisted intelligent decision support system (AIIDSS) has been proposed for the business forecasting process. The current study discusses possible uses of forecasting in strategic decision making, mainly marketing, management. This paper aims to create a model that helps managers better understand this system's link to better forecasting .A decision support system (DSS), integrating the simulation models and the regular model base, components database, report, user interface, and graph services are discussed and outlined. This decision support system is easier to use than the most extensively utilized approach and does not rely too much on human judgment. The Smart Decision Support System (AIIDSS) for Artificial Intelligence was recommended for the company training algorithm. The potential applications of predictions is in policy decisions, particularly marketing and sales. The purpose is to design a framework that helps organizations recognize the connection. A recommendation system (RS) incorporates mathematical equation and the cosmological constant, database function, reporting, interface, and graphics services. This management information system is extremely easy to get and does not depend more and more on logical reasoning than even the most widely used methodology. The numerical results show that AIIDSS enhances the prediction ratio of 96.5%, accuracy ratio of 98.2%, production ratio of 98.35%, demand analysis ratio of 89.7% for business forecasting.",

With the rapid adoption of AI technology in the field of marketing, it is crucial to understand how consumer adoption of the information generated by AI can be improved. This study explores a novel relationship between number presentation details associated with AI and consumers' behavioral and evaluative responses toward AI. We theorized that consumer trust would mediate the preciseness effect on consumer judgment and evaluation of the information provided by AI. The results of five studies demonstrated that the use of a precise (vs. imprecise) information format leads to higher evaluations and behavioral intentions. We also show mediational evidence indicating that the effect of number preciseness is mediated by consumer trust (Studies 2, 4, and 5). We further show that the preciseness effect is moderated by the accuracy of AI-generated information (Study 3) and the objective product quality of the recommended products (Study 4). This study provides theoretical implications to the AI acceptance literature, the information processing literature, the consumer trust literature, and the decision-making literature. Moreover, this study makes practical implications for marketers of AI businesses including those who strategically use AI-generated information.",

   "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) and 5G connectivity have been identified as drivers of the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution (FIR). AI and 5G, through emerging technologies such as blockchain, gene editing, Internet of Things sensors, nanotechnology, or 3D printing accelerate a blurring of boundaries between digital, biological, and physical spheres. In this editorial, we introduce the term boundary object, or boundary technology, that can help process more information (syntactic boundary) for enhanced learning (semantic boundary) and that can create a higher-level intelligence (pragmatic boundary). Boundary objects are also a means of representing, learning about, and transforming knowledge at a given boundary. We propose that crossing syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic boundaries is facilitated by three FIR phenomena (big data, machine learning, and AI). Each of these phenomena possesses a unique capability (processing, learning, and adaptation) to help communities learn about their differences and dependences. We also show how the six articles in this special issue are related to boundary and sphere challenges, and we provide an overview of directions for future research. All in all, marketing scholars should focus on enhancing their abilities in knowledge integration across boundaries to sustain their role as cutting-edge scientists.

   "content": "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to introduce, apply and compare how artificial intelligence (AI), and specifically the IBM Watson system, can be used for content analysis in marketing research relative to manual and computer-aided (non-AI) approaches to content analysis. Design/methodology/approach To illustrate the use of AI-enabled content analysis, this paper examines the text of leadership speeches, content related to organizational brand. The process and results of using AI are compared to manual and computer-aided approaches by using three performance factors for content analysis: reliability, validity and efficiency. Findings Relative to manual and computer-aided approaches, AI-enabled content analysis provides clear advantages with high reliability, high validity and moderate efficiency. Research limitations/implications - This paper offers three contributions. First, it highlights the continued importance of the content analysis research method, particularly with the explosive growth of natural language-based user-generated content. Second, it provides a road map of how to use AI-enabled content analysis. Third, it applies and compares AI-enabled content analysis to manual and computer-aided, using leadership speeches. Practical implications - For each of the three approaches, nine steps are outlined and described to allow for replicability of this study. The advantages and disadvantages of using AI for content analysis are discussed. Together these are intended to motivate and guide researchers to apply and develop AI-enabled content analysis for research in marketing and other disciplines. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is among the first to introduce, apply and compare how AI can be used for content analysis.",

Yet, despite its touted benefits, contemporary implementations of programmatic advertising do not harness self-generative technologies so much so that different consumers are exposed to identical content. Consequently, we advance a smart generation system of personalized advertising copy (SGS-PAC) that can automatically personalize advertising content to align with the needs of individual consumers. Analytical results from a user experiment involving about 80 subjects underscore that personalized advertising copies generated by SGS-PAC can bolster click rate in online advertising platforms. Findings from this study bear significant implications for the application of artificial intelligence in online advertising.",

   "content": "James Watt invented the steam engine in the 17th century. It outperformed human muscle power by orders of magnitude. Nobody imagined that this single invention would evocate massive consequences: The steam engine increased industrial production, led to societal upheaval, and changed the political landscape for the next 100 years. There had been no historical parallel on the effect of a dedicated technical invention on humankind in such a short timefiume. At the beginning of the 21st century, we might experience a similar dynamic. This time, artificial intelligence spread the word of a new era that makes cognitive capabilities available on a large scale. Machines with highly sophisticated mental competencies will turn upside down the knowledge work in every company department, be it marketing, human resources, research and development, customer service, or the even the board of directors. Moreover, this time, intelligent machines will outperform human brain power. This paper argues that the arrival of artificial intelligence at the enterprise pave the way to a wicked problem: It cannot be resolved by tested methodologies, given procedures, and best practices. Instead, it requires a more sophisticated approach: First, companies must involve all relevant stakeholders at the initial stage of deployment because the impact of artificial intelligence is far-reaching. Second, companies must question their given value system because it closely resonates with the capabilities of artificial intelligence machines. Third, companies must conduct controlled experiments, because divide and rule do not work anymore to handle machines that mimic humanthinking. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",

The purpose of the paper is to identify exactly how AI affects the key and support business processes of pharmaceutical companies. We offer a qualitative interview study of five large, five medium, and five small pharmaceutical companies. Based on scarce literature on the role of AI in the pharmaceutical industry, we considered which business processes are subject to transform within it and how they do so. We determine that small pharma companies significantly change research and development, master data management, analysis and reporting, and human resource business processes under the influence of AI. Large pharma companies use AI to transform production, sales, marketing, and analysis business processes. In turn, medium-sized companies are in the middle and individually transform their business processes depending on their specialization.",

Based on a comprehensive literature review, the combined strategies were used to develop a novel decision-making framework. The hypothesised relationships of an SEM model are validated with data collected from 242 managers from various industries. An artificial intelligence (AI)-based method is developed using artificial neural networks (ANN) feeding into a decision-making framework which explores the optimality of the combined strategies. The results indicate that (a) IT strategy is positively mediated by marketing strategy on performance and (b) the organisational structure moderates the mediation of marketing strategy on performance. The analysis confirms that the extracted strategies based on the proposed framework have superior performance compared to existing strategies. This paper contributes to the literature by conceptualising and empirically testing the mediation role of marketing strategy on IT strategy, performance and operational decision-making. The use of a novel three-phase decision-making framework which uses AI processes improves operational efficiency, increases insights and enhances the decision accuracy of complex problems at the strategic level in industries such as manufacturing. It could help operations executives to apply effective decisions.",

The word AI, which is the acronym of artificial intelligence concept, is also frequently used in informatics. Artificial Intelligence studies are generally aimed at developing similar artificial instructions by analyzing human thinking methods. Also, from a point of view, even though it may seem like an attempt by a programmed computer to think, these definitions are changing rapidly, and new orientations are formed towards the concept of Artificial Intelligence that can learn and develop independently from human intelligence in the future. Also, Machine Learning is a method paradigm that makes inferences from existing data using mathematical and statistical methods and makes predictions about the unknown with these inferences, such as face recognition, document classification, spam detection and etc. In addition, nowadays, many big companies such as Google, Facebook and especially Tesla continue their research on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning under the title of Churn Analysis. The purpose of Churn Analysis is to identify the customers who are likely to stop using their service or product. Today's competitive conditions have formed many companies that try to sell the same product very close to each other. Therefore, the existing customer is very valuable. Customer loss can be a significant loss of revenue, especially in environments where customer preferences do not change very often, such as financial services. Moreover, with the help of Churn Analysis, customers' escaping probability with precise estimates can be predicted by saying that the customers' leaving probabilities are. Also, some analysis can be made based on customer segments and loss amount - money's worth. After these analyses, communication can be improved and engagement can be increased to keep the customers. Furthermore, effective marketing campaigns can be created in order to target the customers by calculating the rate of churn or wear. This can significantly increase profitability of the companies. In this paper, the terms Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in computer science and the term Churn Analysis in global marketing have been tried to be combined together. For this purpose, 7043 (11 missing data - 7032 in total) user data with 21 different features - customerID, Gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents, Tenure, PhoneService, MultipleLines, InternetService, OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, TechSupport, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies, Contract, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges and Churn - belonging to Telco Avi (in Telecom Company) have been retrieved and extracted from Kaggle Data Science. Finally, this user data set has been processed, treated and committed by k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) Algorithm, Gaussian Naive Bayes Algorithm and Random Forests Algorithm, which are the Machine Learning Classification Algorithms in Artificial Intelligence - in Python by using its own libraries Pandas, NumPy, Keras, Sklearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc. - in order to recognize and learn the Churn Analysis in the company - Telco Avi.",

I propose a framework for understanding what makes good practice and an expert practitioner that encompasses the technical skills required to do OR through the managerial and marketing skills necessary to run an OR enterprise. The potential for success with OR methods depends on the nature of the problem, whether the initial and goal states are well defined or ill defined. The tools of artificial intelligence are useful for organizing the expertise in being a successful practitioner.",

In this new digital world, companies are facing a new competitive reality, where the rules of engagement across sectors and industries are changing. Thus, enterprises need to adopt a proactive approach in their journey to becoming intelligent, as the service interface will be gradually transformed into a technology-dominant one. Artificial Intelligence-based messaging solutions, namely the conversational bots, represent one of the first stepping stones in order for the companies to become faster, more efficient and capable of providing customers relevant and personalized experiences. Indeed, chatbots can be perceived as the perfect illustration of the development and implementation of customer-centric artificial intelligence that mimic human behavior, which has a wide range of applications in various fields, such as: education, healthcare, financial services, ecommerce etc. By placing the Social Information Processing Theory, Media Equation Theory and CASA Paradigm at the heart of our conceptualization, we developed a model which proposes anthropomorphic design cues as a determinant of both social presence and perceived competence, which in turn will have a positive influence on the trusting beliefs.",

   "content": "Over the past two decades, digitalization has revolutionized not only consumer marketing but also industrial marketing. Both industrial marketing scholars and industrial marketers seek insights to understand how our knowledge and practice of digital marketing has been structured and configured. To address this gap, we adopt the resource-based perspective as an organizing framework and systematically review 129 articles spanning two decades of research to identify different digital marketing capabilities in industrial firms. From this analysis, we identify four themes: channels, social media, digital relationships, and digital technologies. We then stress-test this knowledge with managerial practices by conducting an online survey of 169 managers, designed to establish the repertoire of current and future marketing capability needs of industrial firms. Herein, we identify two marketing capabilities gaps: the practice gap-which identifies the deficit between managers' 'current' practices and their 'ideal' digital marketing capabilities; and, the knowledge gap-which demonstrates a significant divide between the digital marketing transformations in industrial firms and the extant scholarly knowledge that underpins this. Based on these results, we build an agenda for future research on digital marketing capabilities.",

First, we discuss the notion of higher-order learning that distinguishes AI applications from traditional modeling approaches, and while focusing on recent advances in deep neural networks, we cover its underlying methodologies (multilayer perceptron, convolutional, and recurrent neural networks) and learning paradigms (supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning). Second, we discuss the technological pitfalls and dangers marketing managers need to be aware of when implementing AI in their organizations, including the concepts of badly defined objective functions, unsafe or unrealistic learning environments, biased AI, explainable AI, and controllable AI. Third, AI will have a deep impact on predictive tasks that can be automated and require little explainability, we predict that AI will fall short of its promises in many marketing domains if we do not solve the challenges of tacit knowledge transfer between AI models and marketing organizations.

   "content": "Inclusive innovation has not yet reached societal scale due to a well-entrenched divide between wealth creation and social equity. Taking food as the initial test bed, we have proposed the convergent innovation model to address such challenges still facing 21st century society by bridging sectors and disciplines around an integrated goal on both sides of the social-economic divide for innovations that target wealth creation with an upfront consideration of its externalities. The convergent innovation model is empowered by two key enablers that integrate an advanced digital infrastructure with leading scientific knowledge on the drivers of human behaviour in varying contexts. This article discusses the structure, methods, and development of an artificial intelligence platform to support convergent innovation. Insights are gathered on consumer sentiment and behavioural drivers through the analysis of user-generated content on social media platforms. Empirical results show that user discussions related to marketing, consequences, and occasions are positive. Further regression modelling finds that economic consequences are a strong predictor of consumer global sentiment, but are also sensitive to both the actual price and economic awareness. This finding has important implications for inclusive growth and further emphasizes the need for affordable and accessible foods, as well as for consumer education. Challenges and opportunities inspired by the research results are discussed to inform the design, marketing, and delivery of convergent innovation products and services, while also contributing to dimensions of inclusion and economic performance for equitable health and wealth.",

The purpose of this paper is to summarize the state-of-the-art literature and present a holistic view of different types of antecedents of IA technology use in marketing from the consumer's perspective. This paper uses the systematic literature review method and covers 107 articles published in scientific journals between 2000 and 2020. The identified antecedents are categorized into IA characteristics, consumer perceptions, external conditions, as well as individual characteristics and analyzed at the individual level of use. Future research should focus on investigating the relative importance of the effects of IA characteristics, consumer perceptions, external, and individual factors on consumers' intentions to use IAs. This paper argues that while extant technology acceptance models contribute to the understanding of IA use, IAs, due to their unique characteristics (e.g., anthropomorphism) and dimensions (e.g., IA as an interface, as a proxy for the system and an autonomous aggregator and agent), require a new lens to explain the drivers of IA use in data-rich and process-rich environments. The traditional technology acceptance theories provide a valuable, yet incomplete understanding of how consumers use IAs. Drawing from representation theory, this paper proposes a theoretical framework of IA use and argues that IAs act as representations to facilitate the primary goal.",

   "content": "The rise of unstructured data (UD), propelled by novel technologies, is reshaping markets and the management of marketing activities. Yet these increased data remain mostly untapped by many firms, suggesting the potential for further research developments. The integrative framework proposed in this study addresses the nature of UD and pursues theoretical richness and computational advancements by integrating insights from other disciplines. This article makes three main contributions to the literature by (1) offering a unifying definition and conceptualization of UD in marketing; (2) bridging disjoint literature with an organizing framework that synthesizes various subsets of UD relevant for marketing management through an integrative review; and (3) identifying substantive, computational, and theoretical gaps in extant literature and ways to leverage interdisciplinary knowledge to advance marketing research by applying UD analyses to underdeveloped areas.",

   "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) helps companies offer important benefits to consumers, such as health monitoring with wearable devices, advice with recommender systems, peace of mind with smart household products, and convenience with voice-activated virtual assistants. However, although AI can be seen as a neutral tool to be evaluated on efficiency and accuracy, this approach does not consider the social and individual challenges that can occur when AI is deployed. This research aims to bridge these two perspectives: on one side, the authors acknowledge the value that embedding AI technology into products and services can provide to consumers. On the other side, the authors build on and integrate sociological and psychological scholarship to examine some of the costs consumers experience in their interactions with AI. In doing so, the authors identify four types of consumer experiences with AI: (1) data capture, (2) classification, (3) delegation, and (4) social. This approach allows the authors to discuss policy and managerial avenues to address the ways in which consumers may fail to experience value in organizations' investments into AI and to lay out an agenda for future research.",

In addition, customer profitability accounting (CPA) recommends evaluating the CRM program through the combination of partial measures in a global cost-benefit function. Several statistical techniques have been applied for market segmentations although the existence of large data sets reduces their effectiveness. As an alternative, decision trees are machine learning models that do not consider a priori hypotheses, achieve a high performance, and generate logical rules clearly understood by managers. In this article, a three-stage methodology is proposed that combines marketing feature selection, customer segmentation through univariate and oblique decision trees, and a new CPA function based on marketing, data warehousing, and opportunity costs linked to the analysis of different scenarios. This proposal is applied to a large insurance marketing data set for alternative cost and price conditions showing the superiority of univariate decision trees over statistical techniques.",

Disconcertingly, their frequency persists, with four major pandemics disrupting the planet in the last 65 years and more expected in the future. While many of the economic and health consequences of pandemics are well-documented, their marketing implications are less understood. Addressing this gap, we develop a broad, conceptual framework to highlight the characteristics and impacts of pandemics as they relate to marketing. We first identify four macro-level forces that characterize pandemics and highlight their marketing implications. Next, using the 7P marketing mix model as the organizing structure, we discuss these implications at a micro-level and identify a set of research questions to stimulate further inquiry, not only to generate deeper insights pertaining to pandemics' marketing implications but also to envision new developments in these areas. Finally, we identify pandemics' disproportionate impacts on and implications for some industry sectors, including healthcare, retail, education, hospitality, and tourism.",

Design/methodology/approach This paper is based on an overview of the relevant literature on hotel marketing and management and the hotel guest behavior. The authors also investigated hospitality service trends to propose a research agenda. Findings This paper presents a research agenda from three dimensions - artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, hygiene and cleanliness and health and health care. First, different types of AI (mechanical, thinking and feeling) might open up distinct research streams at the intersection of health crises and hotel management, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, this paper recommends that researchers move beyond typical perspectives on the antecedents and outcomes of hotel hygiene and cleanliness to delve into guests' perceptions of the cleanliness of specific hotel surfaces. Furthermore, a more in-depth analysis is warranted about the evolving relationship between hotels and the health-care sector. Practical implications The recommended research areas are intended to advance the knowledge base to help hotels recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. The suggested research streams are expected to provide actionable insights to promote the development and sustainability of the hotel sector. Originality/value This paper appears to be a frontier study, critically examining possible effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on hotel marketing and management practices and how hoteliers may respond to such challenges to recover after this pandemic.",

However, aspects, such as internationalization, the development of artificial intelligence, and stress from growing global competitive forces, have brought about changes in the way leisure farms approach experiential marketing with a significant environmental focus. In this context, the concept of relationship quality offers an opportunity for environmental leisure farms to understand how green experiential marketing impacts consumers' perceived value and the ongoing interaction relationship. This study adopts a comprehensive perspective that includes green experiential marketing and relationship marketing that leisure farms use in order to enhance customer loyalty, and analyzes the effect of a series of elements inherent to customer psychic or personal needs. Seven hundred fifty-four valid copies of questionnaire were adopted in total. To verify the proposed model empirically, a survey of customers of environmental leisure farms in Taiwan was conducted. Structural equation modeling is conducted to examine the research hypotheses. The findings show that, overall, green experiential marketing has positive direct effects on experiential value and experiential value has positive direct effects on trust, commitment, and satisfaction. At the same time, trust and satisfaction have positive effects on attitudinal and behavioral loyalty. In addition, attitudinal loyalty has a positive influence on behavioral loyalty.",

To do this, the study identified areas of digital transformation in marketing that have not yet been sufficiently covered by existing peer-reviewed academic research. Research papers were retrieved from five databases, namely Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Emerald, and ProQuest. Screening of 214 articles resulted in 69 articles being selected for this literature review. A gap in the existing research was identified, with five areas directly related to digital transformation in marketing. Another five potential opportunities for future research in the area of big data utilisation and application of ML-driven technologies in the marketing field were also identified. An investigation of the prospects of digital transformation in marketing can benefit both academic researchers and business practitioners working in the domain of information technologies (IT), information systems (IS), business, and marketing, by identifying areas needing primary research, systemisation, follow-up research, validation or gathering of empirical data.",

First, to provide marketing with an overview of ML, including a review of its major types (supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning) and algorithms, relevance to marketing, and general workflow. Second, to analyze two potential learning strategies for marketing researchers to learn ML: the bottomup (that requires a strong background in general math and calculus, statistics, and programming languages) and the top-down (focused on the implementation of ML algorithms to improve explanations and/or predictions given within the domain of the researcher's knowledge). The third goal is to analyze the ML applications published in top-tier marketing and management journals, books, book chapters, as well as recent working papers on a few promising marketing research sub-fields. Finally, the last goal of the monograph is to discuss possible impacts of trends and future developments of ML to the field of marketing.",

   "content": "Purpose This paper aims to document how AI has changed the way consumers make decisions and propose how that change impacts services marketing, service research and service management. Design/methodology/approach A review of the literature, documentation of sales and customer service experiences support the evolution of bot-driven consumer decision-making, proposing the bot-driven service platform as a key component of the service experience. Findings Today the focus is on convenience, the less time and effort, the better. The authors propose that AI has taken convenience to a new level for consumers. By using bots as their service of choice, consumers outsource their decisions to algorithms, hence give little attention to traditional consumer decision-making models and brand emphasis. At the moment, this is especially true for low involvement types of decisions, but high involvement decisions are on the cusp of delegating to AI. Therefore, management needs to change how they view consumers' decision-making-processes and how services are being managed. Research limitations/implications - In an AI-convenience driven service economy, the emphasis needs to be on search ranking or warehouse stock, rather than the traditional drivers of brand values such as service quality. Customer experience management will shift from interaction with products and services toward interactions with new service platforms such as AI, bots. Hence, service marketing, as the authors know it might be in decline and be replaced by an efficient complex attribute computer decision-making model. Originality/value The change in consumer behavior leads to a change in the service marketing approach needed in the world of AI. The bot, the new service platform is now in charge of search and choice for many purchase situations.",

Businesses have started adopting various technology practices relevant to automation and AI, and research investigating this phenomenon is becoming increasingly important. Taking this as a cue, the present research investigates the effect of human-to-machine interaction and human-to-human interaction towards cognitive absorption and its subsequent effect on trust, experience, and continuation intention in the context of services. The study built a 3 x 3 factorial design with automated chatbots (machine interaction) and service executives (human interaction) used as a stimulus in the experiment. Data collected from 410 respondents were analyzed using structural equation modeling to test the proposed hypotheses. The findings indicated that human-to-machine interaction influences cognitive absorption more positively compared to human-to-human interactions. The study results also provide evidence for the role of the trust, experience, and technology continuation intention in a technology background rooted in human-machine interactions. The present study adds a valuable contribution to the existing literature relevant to human-to-machine interaction, cognitive absorption, trust, experience, and continuation intention. The study also provides valuable inputs to technology and marketing managers.",

This paper studies personalized recommendation techniques that suggest products or services to the customers of Internet storefronts based on their demographics or past purchasing behavior. The underlining theories of recommendation techniques are statistics, data mining, artificial intelligence, and rule-based matching. In the rule-based approach to personalized recommendation, marketing rules For personalization are usually obtained from marketing experts and used to perform inferencing based on customer data. However, it is difficult to extract marketing rules from marketing experts, and to validate and maintain the constructed knowledge base. This paper proposes a marketing rule-extraction technique For personalized recommendation on Internet storefronts using machine learning techniques, and especially decision-tree induction techniques. Using tree induction techniques, data-mining tools can generate marketing rules that match customer demographics to product categories. The extracted rules provide personalized advertisement selection when a customer visits an Internet store. An experiment is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with preference scoring and random selection.",

However, appropriate learning algorithms, evaluation criteria, and validation procedures are necessary for effective implementation of neural networks to provide decision support to managers. This study compares the performance of Bayesian neural networks with that of logistic regression and the backpropagation method in modelling consumer responses. The results of a tenfold stratified cross-validation suggest that although the three methods perform equally well under the error rate, Bayesian neural networks generate higher statistics for the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) and cumulative lifts. The findings suggest that researchers should adopt effective learning algorithms, relevant evaluation criteria and appropriate validation procedures for neural networks to model consumer responses and solve marketing problems facing today's businesses.",

   "content": "In this article, we explore how digital marketers think about marketing in the age of Big Data surveillance, automatic computational analyses, and algorithmic shaping of choice contexts. Our starting point is a contradiction at the heart of digital marketing namely that digital marketing brings about unprecedented levels of consumer empowerment and autonomy and total control over and manipulation of consumer decision-making. We argue that this contradiction of digital marketing is resolved via the notion of relevance, which represents what Fredric Jameson calls a symbolic act. The notion of the symbolic act lets us see the centering of relevance as a creative act of digital marketers who undertake to symbolically resolve a contradiction that cannot otherwise be resolved. Specifically, we suggest that relevance allows marketers to believe that in the age of surveillance capitalism, the manipulation of choice contexts and decision-making is the same as consumer empowerment. Put differently, relevance is the moment when marketing manipulation disappears and all that is left is the empowered consumer. To create relevant manipulations that are experienced as empowering by the consumer requires always-on surveillance, massive analyses of consumer data and hyper-targeted responses, in short, a persistent marketing presence. The vision of digital marketing is therefore a fascinating one: marketing disappears at precisely the moment when it extends throughout the life without limit.",

   "content": "Background and Objective: Tourism and travel sector continues to grow by gaining an important place in the world economy and many countries want to increase their share in this sector. At the same time, it is known that today's consumer tourism and travel purchase decisions are influenced by social media. By examining the data of consumers on social media, it is possible for businesses to reach the right person and get more efficiency from high-cost promotion activities. The study aims to analyze the historical data of users on TripAdvisor with artificial intelligence methods to reveal a profile of consumers who might prefer Turkey. Methods: In this context, TripAdvisor, which is one of the best-known websites in the tourism sector, is an important source of data for countries to increase their share in the tourism market. Inferences can be made by using artificial intelligence methods and the data in TripAdvisor together. In this study, as a case study, the potentials of Chinese tourists to prefer Turkey are dealt because Turkey has increased its tourism targets ten folds for China and the year 2018 was declared as Turkey Tourism Year in China. In this context, this study aims to determine the potentials of Chinese tourists to prefer Turkey, by processing travel data histories obtained from TripAdvisor with artificial intelligence methods. It is expected that the study will contribute to the tourism sector as well as the academic literature. The study used the travel data history of Chinese tourists taken from TripAdvisor. Significant travel histories were selected by the F-score method. Depending on the selected and all travel histories of users, their travel preferences (Turkey/France) were classified by artificial intelligence algorithms. The developed model was tested with performance criteria. Results: At the end of the study, it was ensured that the Chinese, who would prefer Turkey, were determined with an accuracy rate of 75.25% and sensitivity rate of 0.76. Conclusions: It was observed that it is possible to find the tourists who will prefer Turkey by using the developed system. In other words, the study revealed that the countries can reach the individual instead of masses in their promotional activities.",

   "content": "We discuss the objectives of any endeavor in creating artificial intelligence, AI, and provide a possible alternative. Intelligence might be an unintended consequence of curiosity left to roam free, best exemplified by a frolicking infant. This suggests that our attempts at AI could have been misguided. What we actually need to strive for can be termed artificial curiosity, AC, and intelligence happens as a consequence of those efforts. For this unintentional yet welcome aftereffect to set in a foundational list of guiding principles needs to be present. We start with the intuition for this line of reasoning and formalize it with a series of definitions, assumptions, ingredients, models and iterative improvements that will be necessary to make the incubation of intelligence a reality. Our discussion provides conceptual modifications to the Turing Test and to Searle?s Chinese room argument. We discuss the future implications for society as AI becomes an integral part of life. We provide a road-map for creating intelligence with the technical parts relegated to the appendix so that the article is accessible to a wide audience. The central techniques in our formal approach to creating intelligence draw upon tools and concepts widely used in physics, cognitive science, psychology, evolutionary biology, statistics, linguistics, communication systems, pattern recognition, marketing, economics, finance, information science and computational theory highlighting that solutions for creating artificial intelligence have to transcend the artificial barriers between various fields and be highly multi-disciplinary.",

The research gap analysis revealed that a little is known about marketers' attitude toward, and knowledge about, ML tools and their adoption and utilization to support strategic and operational management. The research presented here focuses on the selection and adoption of the ML-driven analytical tools by three distinct groups: marketing agencies, media companies, and advertisers. Qualitative and quantitative research was conducted on a sample of these organizations operating in Slovakia. The findings highlight: 1) the important role of intelligent analytical tools in the creation and deployment of marketing strategies; 2) the lack of knowledge about emerging technologies, such as ML and artificial intelligence (AI); 3) the potential application of the ML tools in marketing, and; 4) the low level of adoption and utilization of the ML-driven analytical tools in marketing management. A framework consisting of enablers and a process map was developed to help organizations identify the opportunities and successfully execute projects that are oriented toward the deployment and adoption of the analytical ML tools in digital marketing.",

The main body of this research is characterised by the proposal of a brand new and complete methodology for knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), to be applied in marketing causal modelling and with utilities to be used as a marketing management decision support tool. Such methodology is based on Genetic Fuzzy Systems, a specific hybridization of artificial intelligence methods, highly suited to the research problem we face. The use of KDD methodologies based on intelligent systems like this can be considered as an avant-garde evolution, exponent nowadays of the so-called knowledge-based Marketing Management Support Systems; we name them as Marketing Intelligent Systems. The most important questions to the KDD process-i.e. pre-processing; machine learning and post-processing-are discussed in depth and solved. After its theoretical presentation, we empirically experiment with it, using a consumer behaviour model of reference. In this part of the paper, we try to offer an overall perspective of how it works. The valuation of its performance and utility is very positive. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

Some online businesses have recently begun to adopt automation technologies that are capable of altering both their own, and consumers', legal rights and obligations. In a rapidly evolving field known as affective computing, the creators of some automation technologies are utilizing various principles of cognitive science and artificial intelligence to generate avatars capable of gamering consumer trust. Unfortunately, this trust has been exploited by some to under-take extensive, clandestine consumer profiling under the guise of friendly conversation. Buddy bots and other such applications have been used by businesses to collect valuable personal information and private communications without lawful consent. This article critically examines such practices and provides basic consumer protection principles, an adherence to which promises to generate a more socially responsible vision of the application of artificial intelligence in automated electronic commerce.",

With AI coming under the spotlight, we know surprisingly little about its impact on consumers' patronage likelihood. This research attempts to address this void by investigating the just-walk-out retail technology in cohort with in-store communication. Across three studies, conducted online and in the field, the authors demonstrate that, compared to self-service checkouts, AI-enabled checkouts lead to significantly higher consumers' patronage likelihood. Furthermore, sensory stimulation stemming from in-store communication (environmental cues including assortment, advertising, and technology) underlies this impact. Importantly, the extent to which consumers perceive AI technology to be threatening is revealed as a boundary condition to these effects. These findings advance our understanding of how AI-enabled checkouts and in-store communication influence consumers' patronage likelihood and the boundary condition that moderates their impact.",

   "content": "Continuous advances in information technologies, such as Artificial intelligence (AI), are opening up new and exciting opportunities for value co-creation between economic actors. However, little is known about the mechanisms and the process of value co-creation enabled by AI. While scholars agree that AI technology significantly changes human activities and human resources, currently we do not have an adequate understanding of how humans and AI technology interact in value co-creation. This is the central phenomenon investigated in this article. Specifically, using Service-Dominant Logic (S-DL) as a lens, this study investigates the activities, roles and resources that are exchanged in Al-enabled value co-creation, using the creation of competitive intelligence as a research context. The analysis suggests that Al-enabled value co-creation processes are complex interactions between human and non-human actors who perform any of six different roles either jointly or independently. This article contributes to SD-L and provides a deeper understanding of the activities (the 'how'), the actors (the 'who'), and the resources (the 'what') in Al-enabled value co-creation, thus helping to close an identified gap in the literature.",

First, we analyse the multiway flow of QM in the stages of plan - design - production - marketing - sales, and data-oriented multiway interactions for creating new value and quality are discussed. Second, four distinctive approaches are introduced for implementing the multiway flow in real-world applications. The four approaches, which utilise Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and more, are composite dimension, team creativity, total inspection, and new valuation. Finally, we argue for the necessity of combining quality experts with data scientists to prepare well for the coming Fourth Industrial Revolution.",

   "content": "Big data has been generated in various fields. Many companies have now tried to make profits by building a system capable of analyzing big data based on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Integrating AI technology has made analyzing and utilizing vast amounts of data increasingly valuable. In particular, demand forecasting with maximum accuracy is critical to government and business management in various fields such as finance, procurement, production and marketing. In this case, it is important to apply an appropriate model that considers the demand pattern for each field. It is possible to analyze complex patterns of real data that can also be enlarged by a traditional time series model or regression model. However, choosing the right model among the various models is difficult without prior knowledge. Many studies based on AI techniques such as machine learning and deep learning have been proven to overcome these problems. In addition, demand forecasting through the analysis of stereotyped data and unstructured data of images or texts has also shown high accuracy. This paper introduces important areas where demand forecasts are relatively active as well as introduces machine learning and deep learning techniques that consider the characteristics of each field.",

Banks implement AI to provide digital assistance and financial advice to clients, measure their financial standing etc. The paper also includes cases of the AI solutions marketing and some ideas of brand-new banking AI-based services. Despite the rapid spreading of AI across the different spheres, its efficiency is based, primarily, on consumers' attitude and loyalty to this technology. Our research shows that Russian business and consumers perceive AI in a positive light. Sberbank specialists have a positive attitude to the AI implementation in their work, consider these solutions as assistance in performing routine operations and are not afraid of dismissals. They use AI solutions both at work and in everyday life. The emerging fears are associated with possible technical failure, unauthorized transmission of personal data, lack of privacy, and unexpected consequences of AI implementation. However, in general, experts understand that the future of the financial sector is connected with this technology. According to Sberbank employees, consumers tend to demonstrate a certain level of mistrust to AI, which could result from misunderstanding of how this technology works, and what impact it has on their ways of life. Meanwhile, the level of AI resistance from both sides decreases with time. Therefore, state and financial mediators could create necessary conditions for banking development based on modern technologies.",

Either logistic regression or multiple regression models were developed and then were compared to ANN models using the same set of input variables. Three sets of B2B data were used to test the models. Emphasis also was placed on evaluating small samples. Findings ANN models tend to generate model predictions that are more accurate or the same as logistic regression models. However, when ANN models are compared to multiple regression models, the results are mixed. For small sample sizes, the modeling results are the same as for larger samples. Originality/value The research contributes to the B2B marketing literature by providing a more rigorous test on ANN models using B2B data than has been conducted before.",

Amazon, in particular, has been a key trendsetter in this area through its Alexa-powered devices. Alexa is an intelligent personal assistant (IPA) that performs tasks, such as playing music, providing news and information, and controlling smart home appliances. While this IPA is widely utilized, it is especially gaining attention and growing usage by people with special needs. Even though the importance of the utilization of AI by people with special needs has been widely acknowledged in the extant literature, a sizeable gap exists in the marketing literature in relation to the assessment of the managerial and societal implications of IPAs when used by people with special needs. Accordingly, this study aims to examine (a) the stages of relationship development between Alexa and consumers with special needs, and (b) the potential opportunity of this relationship for Amazon in relation to their corporate image. The findings indicate that a relationship between Alexa and consumers with special needs is established as it helps them regain their independence and freedom. This relationship provides an opportunity for Amazon in enhancing its overall image for providing solutions to facilitate the lives of people with special needs.",

Nowadays the most companies struggle with business revenue due to the pandemic situation of COVID-19 disease. Many business processes moved to the online area, especialy daily workers cooperation, communication with customers, sales support, and almost all types of marketing activities. Experience has shown that the key to success in business is the adequate setup of the communication tools. This issue is important not only in the company, but it took a crucial role in the communication with customers. Customers had to adapt to the new COVID-19 situation that dramatically changed their shopping habits. The survey responses were divided into two basic groups focused on traditional marketing and modern (online) tools. The research rests on data from the interviews with 825 managers or owners of smal and medium-sized enterprises of the Slovak Republic. Data were examined using descriptive and regression analysis. The presented results showed that traditional and modern tools of marketing communication impacted increasing the innovation of companies. Besides, the impact of business internationalization on increasing business innovation has been demonstrated. The results were supplemented using various modern marketing tools. For evaluating these results, the method of calculation of constructed surface polygons was used. The findings showed that modern marketing communication tools were better for innovative companies than for non-innovative ones. This difference is up to 14.7%. Moreover, the findings showed many possibilities for improving modern marketing communication tools such as artificial intelligence in online communication through mobile marketing applications, analytical tools, or chatbots.",

However, there are a number of product categories for which only inaccurate sales figures or data about marketing efforts exist (e.g., because a significant part of the sales is realized in stores without scanners or which do not make the data available to firm outsiders). In such cases, reliable quantitative findings about the impact of marketing-mix variables on sales may not be achievable but qualitative reasoning may, at least, indicate likely implications of past or planned marketing activities in terms of directions of change. Even in markets with good data qualitative reasoning may be a worthwhile first modelling approach when market conditions change so significantly that a previously used model is deemed unsatisfactory and not enough data exist yet for a specification of a revised quantitative model. We show specifically how qualitative reasoning can be used to diagnose and predict market share changes. The diagnostic part represents a combination of qualitative reasoning and extensions of a previously published rule-based expert system for that task while the prognostic part is solely based on qualitative process theory and order of magnitude reasoning.",

This study used questionnaire survey method to understand user data and used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze the relationship of various dimensions. The results showed that understanding information security awareness and customer alienation through AI technology has a positive impact on consumers' privacy concerns. Through privacy management, consumers can indeed reduce their doubts about privacy leakage. Customer privacy concerns and customer calibration have positive and significant effects on privacy management and self-disclosure, respectively. This study showed that user trust in the platform will affect the degree of user information disclosure. The industry should focus more on the user's privacy maintenance and establish a complete protection mechanism.",

Drawing on delegation theory, this article extends the marketing literature by explaining technology, consumer, and country differences in the formation of demand for AI-empowered consumer products (AI products). Based on hierarchical linear modeling of 2,775 consumer evaluations of automobile add-on autonomous driving systems across five countries, this study finds that the utilitarian (related to efficient goal achievement), hedonic (related to emotions), and symbolic (related to the consumer's self-concept) dimensions of perceived value all contribute substantially to AI product demand. Regarding technology differences, the degree of AI product autonomy enhances the effects of both hedonic and symbolic value and weakens the effect of utilitarian value on AI product demand. Regarding country differences, cultural performance orientation enhances the effect of utilitarian value on AI product demand. Regarding consumer differences, a consumer's independent self-construal weakens the effects of hedonic and symbolic value. Moreover, a consumer's inherent activeness weakens the effect of utilitarian value and strengthens the effect of symbolic value on AI product demand. Based on these results, the article discusses implications for marketing scholars and practitioners and for public policy-makers.",

While recent studies have highlighted the influence that brands might have on innovation adoption decisions, surprisingly little is understood about the role of brands in overcoming consumer resistance to radical innovation such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. To address this, we investigate consumer resistance to AI-powered technology in the context of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, this study builds on the self-brand connection and brand concept literature to examine: (1) the mechanism through which self-brand connection influences radical innovation adoption by mitigating consumer resistance; (2) how this mechanism is moderated by the brand concept (conservation vs. openness); and (3) how brands can effectively overcome consumer resistance through marketing communications. By means of three empirical studies, we find that self-brand connections are positively associated with intentions to adopt radical innovation and that this effect is mediated by reduced risk barriers (Study 1). We further demonstrate that the influence of self-brand connection is much lower for conservation brands than for openness brands (Study 2). Finally, we show that conservation brands can leverage consumers' self-brand connection when they effectively enhance their innovation capabilities through marketing communications (Study 3).",

This includes the artificial intelligence deployment, which enables monitoring of a huge number of parameters of economic, political and social processes in general and in relation to a relevant region or to an economic cluster, and implementing adequate executive decision-making procedures. The review of regional economic processes reveals a connection and interaction between their individual parameters, such as the ability to operate and interact with other systems without any restrictions, with reference to geographic location, or the so called geo-interoperability. This concept is closely related to the theory of geo-information space (GIS), a phenomenon formed by System of Systems, which includes components of natural and artificial origin and has certain synergistic properties. The article reviews a number of features of the GIS approach in the study of distributed social, ecological, economic and marketing processes, including their versatility, interdisciplinarity and the possibility of using the advantages of a systematic approach in these studies. There are various approaches to assessing such properties of the marketing geospace as adaptability, self-learning, self-adjustment, and sustainable development.

At present, compared with English text sentiment classification, the research on Chinese text sentiment classification is not deep enough. Therefore, sentiment classification of Chinese short text has great research value. This paper studies the influence of word vector, network structure, training method and loss function on deep learning text classification model. Firstly, the influence of word vector on the accuracy of deep learning text classification model is analyzed. It is found that the deep learning text classification model can obtain higher accuracy by using the pre trained word vector. Considering the fact that the wheel in textcnn will lose the important function information, this paper improves the wheel method and obtains the K-maxcnn network. Compared with the original network, k-max-cnn network and four improved DCNN networks can achieve higher accuracy. Secondly, aiming at the instability of the training results of deep learning, this paper proposes a line by line learning training method, which is difficult at the beginning but simple later, and proves that this method makes the results more stable through experiments. Finally, using word vector and network model, and using line by line learning training method, some deep learning models are trained and text classification is established, which is applied to text emotion classification. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the proposed method is improved by 0.79%, 2.85% and 2.05% compared with the most accurate model.",

The tourism sector has been one of the most affected, with significant impacts on the number of cancelled reservations, a decrease in international travel and changes in consumption behaviour. This study aims to analyse the main changes in promotion and marketing in the tourism sector in Spain after the pandemic. To this end, a qualitative analysis was carried out via questionnaire-based interviews with 65 experts in the areas of marketing, consumer behaviour and tourism. The main findings show that online information sources gained weight over consulting friends and relatives, and a great advance in digitization is expected, where physical travel agencies will be displaced by online platforms, except for specialized and advisory services. Additionally, technologies such as virtual reality (VR) or artificial intelligence (AI) may play an increasingly important role in the medium term.",

   "content": "According to the World Bank, a key factor to poverty reduction and improving prosperity is financial inclusion. Financial service providers (FSPs) offering financially-inclusive solutions need to understand how to approach the underserved successfully. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) on legacy data can help FSPs to anticipate how prospective customers may respond when they are approached. However, it remains challenging for FSPs who are not well-versed in computer programming to implement AI projects. This paper proffers a no-coding human-centric AI-based approach to simulate the possible dynamics between the financial profiles of prospective customers collected from 45,211 contact encounters and predict their intentions toward the financial products being offered. This approach contributes to the literature by illustrating how AI for social good can also be accessible for people who are not well-versed in computer science. A rudimentary AI-based predictive modeling approach that does not require programming skills will be illustrated in this paper. In these AI-generated multi-criteria optimizations, analysts in FSPs can simulate scenarios to better understand their prospective customers. In conjunction with the usage of AI, this paper also suggests how AI-Thinking could be utilized as a cognitive scaffold for educing (drawing out) actionable insights to advance financial inclusion.",

Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review was conducted under the McKinsey's Global Institute (Talwar and Koury, 2017) methodological perspective that identifies the four ways (i.e. project, produce, promote and provide) in which BDAI creates value. The authors enhanced this analysis methodology by depicting relevant challenges as well. Findings The findings imply that BDAI create value for the tourism sector through appropriately identified disseminations. The benefits of adopting BDAI strategies include increased efficiency, productivity and profitability for tourism suppliers combined with an extremely rich and personalized experience for travellers. The authors conclude that challenges can be bypassed by adopting a BDAI strategy. Such an adoption will stand critical for the competitiveness and resilience of existing established and new players in the tourism sector. Originality/value Besides identifying the benefits that BDAI brings in the tourism sector, the research proposes a guidebook to overcome challenges when introducing such new technologies. The exploration of the BDAI literature brings important implication for managers, academicians and consumers. This is the first systematic review in an area and contributes to the broader e-commerce marketing, retailing and e-tourism research.",

In brick-and-mortar retailing marketing actions that are conducted for large-scale grid based on an arbitrarily set distribution area - not tailored to single stores. This is mainly due to the lack of data and missing processes for automatization of marketing management. Even though the collection of data is easy to establish, the resulting data quality and condition is a problem for many clustering algorithms. Even methods of Machine Learning that are considered to be more robust to noise have issues with the unpredictable nature of such data collection, as they rely on a predefined structure. This paper presents a method for collecting a large amount of relevant location information for a major German brick-and-mortar retailer from online data sources and mapping them to a grid model of Germany at the level of 1 km(2). The clustering is conducted using methods of Machine Learning, in particular Growing Neural Gas (GNG), a neural network variation. The resulting store clusters are then tested for the purpose of location specific marketing. The GNG adapts good to the noisy data and the practical quality is feasible.",

   "content": "Despite the growing number of brands that rely on chatbots to address customer service inquiries that once required human intervention, academics and practitioners are only beginning to acknowledge the role of chatbots in brand-building activities. Chatbots can initiate online conversations, thereby often serving as a consumer's first brand impression. However, little is known about how managers can strategically tailor a chatbot's initial message to foster consumer-brand connections and, ultimately, engagement. Three studies demonstrate that when chatbots initiate a conversation using a warm (vs. competent) message, brand engagement increases, as assessed using both computerized text analysis and traditional scale measures. Brand-self distance mediates this effect, such that a warm (vs. competent) initial chatbot message makes consumers feel closer to the brand. Further, the authors identify brand affiliation as a theoretically relevant moderator. This research thus offers managers insight into how initial chatbot messages can attract and engage consumers.",

This paper explains the reason by introducing service context. Two situational experiments are used to demonstrate that under the context of high perceived control, customers expect AI service agents with more anthropomorphic designs to perform better and prefer highly human-like AI service agents. However, under the context of low perceived control, customers perceive stronger threat in facing AI service agents with more anthropomorphic designs and prefer less human-like AI service agents. Moreover, we find that this effect is significant only in social scenarios. These findings provide new insights into previous inconsistent evidence regarding anthropomorphic design's influence on customers' willingness to use AI service agents. Our findings also have important implications for AI service agents design in different service contexts and advance the literature on human-robot interaction and marketing.",

   "content": "The development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies is proceeding fast across many fields. Based on a deep learning approach, we propose a prototype of an on-site customer profiling and hyper-personalization system (OSCPHPS) targeted at marketing professionals. We propose an AI platform to create customer profiles during their physical presence in stores. The idea of the OSCPHPS prototype is to automatically detect and gather customer data directly from the store, essentially completing customer profiles containing gender, age, personality, emotions, and products they interacted with or bought, irrespective of where they are in the store. Each buying operation could generate an anonymous customer profile. Therefore, for every product sold, the system will track multiple customer-generated profiles of the people who bought that product. These kinds of data offer endless further possibilities for the business. Through a configurational study conducted via fsQCA methodology, we assessed the interest in the OSCPHPS prototype on the part of marketing managers of clothes & fashion stores located in different European countries. Based on these live generated profiles, we could further enhance the OSCPHPS system by adding support for customer segmentation, strategic product campaigns, live product recommendation, analysis of emotions toward a product or a category of products, sales forecasts, and personalized store space enhancements based on augmented reality, customer exploratory statistics and customer purchasing patterns.",

   "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human behavior in relation to the processes of intelligence involved in problem solving. Such mechanisms include human cognitive science reading, observation, preparation, interpretation, reasoning, correction, speech recognition, linguistics, and other sources. AI simplifies tasks by making machines learn from past experiences, mapping efforts and actions to results, identifying errors, correcting them, adjusting to new and random input values, and effortlessly performing human-like tasks through in-depth scenario analysis. AI simplifies work by analyzing, filtering, sorting, predicting, scoping, and determining large data volumes to follow the best implementation procedures for producing an optimal solution. The major pharmaceutical industry applications of AI as on 2019 are; Discovery and development of new drugs; AI is helping big pharma create cures for complex and rare diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson, Drug-Adherence and Dosage; Using AI to make sense of clinical data and to produce better analytics; Finding more reliable patients faster for clinical trials; Introducing automated robot pharmacies to fill prescriptions and dispensing; and marketing, logistics and supply chain. AI is the future of pharma but the technology is available now. Artificial Intelligence can cut costs down, create new, effective treatments and above all else, help save lives. So biotech companies should start making use of the advantages of AI at the earliest. The industry therefore has a lot to gain from embracing solutions to AI and machine learning. It can be used to create a strong, sustainable pipeline of new medicines to good effect. Using the power of modern supercomputers and machine learning would make it possible for us to produce medicines faster and at reduced costs. This article reviews exhaustively the present status and future prospects of Artificial Intelligence in pharmaceutical sciences with specific attention to pharmaceutical industry. The literature has been collected from Pubmed, Google Scholar and commercial websites related to this field. More emphasis has been given to commercial application of AI in pharmaceutical industry in future. In conclusion, the future lies in cooperation between humans and machines, and alongside technological advances, human clinical experts will need to adapt, learn and grow. Although potential experts will have to be both medical and technology experts, it is evolution of medicine, not extinction.",

At the same time, questions about whether HR analytics tools will be used in ways that help or harm racial fairness in employment have been raised. In fact, in some instances the use of HR analytics has triggered lawsuits and new legislation. To assess HR analytics vendors' positions on the matter of racial fairness, a study was conducted of their webpage content pertaining to the matter. Among 121 vendors included in the sample, only nine had content on their webpages pertaining to racial fairness. This may be a surprisingly low frequency in view of the current global attention being given to racism. The goal of this study was to generate some initial data and stimulate interest in additional research. In particular, future research is needed to determine why so few HR analytics vendors mentioned racial concerns on their webpages. Since this study was exploratory in nature, definitive conclusions would be inappropriate. Nevertheless, findings suggest an HR analytics vendor could differentiate itself among competitors if it were to use its website landing page to clearly emphasize concern for racial fairness in how their products are used. The current study did not find HR analytics vendors had much to say about the effects of their products and services on racial fairness.",

Related academic literature is fragmented, lacking both definitional consistency and conceptual clarity. This article makes three main contributions to avatar theory and managerial practice. First, to address ambiguity with respect to its definition, this study identifies and critically evaluates key conceptual elements of the term avatar, offers a definition derived from this analysis, and provides a typology of avatars' design elements. Second, the proposed 2 x 2 avatar taxonomy suggests that the alignment of an avatar's form realism and behavioral realism, across different contingencies, provides a parsimonious explanation for avatar effectiveness. Third, the authors develop an emerging theory of avatar marketing by triangulating insights from fundamental elements of avatars, a synthesis of extant research, and business practices. This framework integrates key theoretical insights, research propositions, and important managerial implications for this expanding area of marketing strategy. Lastly, the authors outline a research program to test the propositions and insights as well as advance future research.",

The upsurge in big data applications is a direct consequence of the drastic boom in information technology as well as the growing number of internet-connected devices called the Internet of Things in healthcare. Compared with business, marketing, and other sectors, healthcare applications are lagging due to a lack of technical knowledge among healthcare workers, technological limitations in acquiring and analyzing the data, and improper governance of healthcare big data. Despite these limitations, the medical literature is flooded with big data- related articles, and most of these are filled with abstruse terminologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, artificial neural network, and algorithm. Many of the recent articles are restricted to neurosurgical registries, creating a false impression that big data is synonymous with registries. Others advocate that the utilization of big data will be the panacea to all healthcare problems and research in the future. Without a proper understanding of these principles, it becomes easy to get lost without the ability to differentiate hype from reality. To that end, the authors give a brief narrative of big data analysis in neurosurgery and review its applications, limitations, and the challenges it presents for neurosurgeons and healthcare professionals naive to this field. Awareness of these basic concepts will allow neurosurgeons to understand the literature regarding big data, enabling them to make better decisions and deliver personalized care.",

   "content": "In this paper, we propose an automated marketing information system for recognizing customer attributes using pressure sensors and artificial intelligence technology. In this case, the customer attribute refers to the gender of customers in retail outlets such as supermarkets, shopping malls and shopping centers. In Japan, many retailers are now facing problems of low productivity per unit selling area. The ability to recognize customer attributes enables retailers to target a specific customer class, which can improve responses to special sales promotions and lead to improved sales. At the place of measurement, such as the entrance or shopping aisles, the system can recognize the attributes of various customers in detail. The apparatus used in this study is a pressure sensor that has the advantage of not invading customer privacy. Customer gender is estimated by measuring foot size, foot shape, step and weight. From the obtained experimental results, we verified that the proposed system can recognize customer attributes. Our research can contribute to raising the productivity of a retail area using information technology.",

While there are different approaches available, most lack in automation, scalability and monitoring capabilities. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility towards an automated prioritization and quantification of customer needs from social media data. To do so, we apply a supervised machine learning approach on the example of previously labeled Twitter data from the domain of e-mobility. We descriptively code over 1000 German tweets and build eight distinct classification models, so that a resulting artifact can independently determine the probabilities of a tweet containing each of the eight previously defined needs. To increase the scope of application, we deploy the machine learning models as part of a web service for public use. The resulting artifact can provide valuable insights for need elicitation and monitoring when analyzing user-generated content on a large scale.",

We suggest that by embracing rather than banning technology, faculty enfranchise students through increased sensory experiences and enhanced digital activities, which will lead to greater learning. We contend that vested stakeholders-institutions of higher education, professional associations, publishing companies, and technology companies-need to support and strengthen faculty efforts in embracing technology to continuously enhance learning.",

   "content": "There are several areas in which organisations can adopt technologies that will support decision-making: artificial intelligence is one of the most innovative technologies that is widely used to assist organisations in business strategies, organisational aspects and people management. In recent years, attention has increasingly been paid to human resources (HR), since worker quality and skills represent a growth factor and a real competitive advantage for companies. After having been introduced to sales and marketing departments, artificial intelligence is also starting to guide employee-related decisions within HR management. The purpose is to support decisions that are based not on subjective aspects but on objective data analysis. The goal of this work is to analyse how objective factors influence employee attrition, in order to identify the main causes that contribute to a worker's decision to leave a company, and to be able to predict whether a particular employee will leave the company. After the training, the obtained model for the prediction of employees' attrition is tested on a real dataset provided by IBM analytics, which includes 35 features and about 1500 samples. Results are expressed in terms of classical metrics and the algorithm that produced the best results for the available dataset is the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier. It reveals the best recall rate (0.54), since it measures the ability of a classifier to find all the positive instances and achieves an overall false negative rate equal to 4.5% of the total observations.",

   "content": "Purpose The creation and dissemination of fake news can have severe consequences for a company's brand. Researchers, policymakers and practitioners are eagerly searching for solutions to get us out of the fake news crisis. Here, one approach is to use automated tools, such as artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, to support managers in identifying fake news. The study in this paper demonstrates how AI with its ability to analyze vast amounts of unstructured data, can help us tell apart fake and real news content. Using an AI application, this study examines if and how the emotional appeal, i.e., sentiment valence and strength of specific emotions, in fake news content differs from that in real news content. This is important to understand, as messages with a strong emotional appeal can influence how content is consumed, processed and shared by consumers. Design/methodology/approach The study analyzes a data set of 150 real and fake news articles using an AI application, to test for differences in the emotional appeal in the titles and the text body between fake news and real news content. Findings The results suggest that titles are a strong differentiator on emotions between fake and real news and that fake news titles are substantially more negative than real news titles. In addition, the results reveal that the text body of fake news is substantially higher in displaying specific negative emotions, such as disgust and anger, and lower in displaying positive emotions, such as joy. Originality/value This is the first empirical study that examines the emotional appeal of fake and real news content with respect to the prevalence and strength of specific emotion dimensions, thus adding to the literature on fake news identification and marketing communications. In addition, this paper provides marketing communications professionals with a practical approach to identify fake news using AI.",

In addition, combined with changes such as social distancing and lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, digital disruption has largely impacted the old ways of communication both at the individual and organizational levels, ultimately resulting in prominent social change. While interacting in the virtual world, this change is more noticeable. Therefore, the second research objective is to examine if a satisfying experience during online shopping leads to repurchase intention. Design/methodology/approach Using primary data collected from consumers in a developing economy (India), we tested the theoretical model to further extend the theoretical debate in consumer research. Findings This study empirically tests and further establishes that deploying AI technologies have a positive relationship with user engagement and conversion. Further, conversion leads to satisfying user experience. Finally, the relationship between satisfying user experience and repurchase intention is also found to be significant. Originality/value The uniqueness of this study is that it tests few key relationships related to user engagement during this uncertain period (COVID-19 pandemic) and examines the underlying mechanism which leads to increase in online sales.",

We propose to revisit the content understanding problem in digital marketing from three novel perspectives. First, our problem is to explore the way how user experience is delivered with divergent key multimedia elements. Second, we treat understanding as to elucidate their causal implications in driving user responses. Third, we propose to understand content based on observational audience visit logs. To approach this problem, we measure and generate heterogeneous content features and model them as binary, multivalued or continuous genres. Multiple key performance indicators (KPIs) are introduced to quantify user responses. We then develop a flexible and adaptive doubly robust estimator to identify the causality between these features and user responses from observational data. The comprehensive experiments are performed on real-world data sets. We show that the further analysis of the experimental results can shed actionable insights on how to improve KPIs. Our work will benefit content distribution and optimization in digital marketing.",

Base classifiers suitable for each test telemarketing campaign are integrated according to the dynamic-based base classifiers integration method. Experimental results on bank telemarketing data show that META-DES-AAP achieves the best accuracy and the largest average profit when compared across several state-of-the-art machine learning methods. In addition, the factors influencing telemarketing on the average predicted probability of telemarketing success and average profit obtained by META-DES-AAP are analyzed.",

The development and strategic exploitation of the Internet has transformed the basis of marketing. Using the evidence from a Web survey this study reveals the way relationships are being created and managed within the hotel industry by its use of the Web as a marketing toot The authors have collected evidence on the way hotels build and create relationships with their Web presence delivering multi-media information as well as channel and interactive means of communication. In addition a strategic framework is offered as the means to describe the mechanism and orientation of Web based marketing by hotels. Furthermore, it is anticipated that the emergence of agent technology will fundamentally change the interface between the customer and the hotel Web site. Currently, intelligent agents are the focus of intense interest in the field of artificial intelligence and are described as the 'new revolution in software' (Guilfoyle and Warner, 1994). Hotels will need to be aware of agent technology and how agents cart be used to promote hotel products in the global electronic market.",

The growth of MLPA could be fueled by payment reforms that hold health care organizations responsible for providing high-quality, cost-effective care. Policy analysts, ethicists, and computer scientists have identified unique ethical and regulatory challenges from the use of MLPA in health care. However, little is known about the types of MLPA health care products available on the market today or their stated goals. Objective: This study aims to better characterize available MLPA health care products, identifying and characterizing claims about products recently or currently in use in US health care settings that are marketed as tools to improve health care efficiency by improving quality of care while reducing costs. Methods: We conducted systematic database searches of relevant business news and academic research to identify MLPA products for health care efficiency meeting our inclusion and exclusion criteria. We used content analysis to generate MLPA product categories and characterize the organizations marketing the products. Results: We identified 106 products and characterized them based on publicly available information in terms of the types of predictions made and the size, type, and clinical training of the leadership of the companies marketing them. We identified 5 categories of predictions made by MLPA products based on publicly available product marketing materials: disease onset and progression, treatment, cost and utilization, admissions and readmissions, and decompensation and adverse events. Conclusions: Our findings provide a foundational reference to inform the analysis of specific ethical and regulatory challenges arising from the use of MLPA to improve health care efficiency.",

One specific goal for many enterprises consists in maximizing the aggregated CLV associated with its set of customers. To achieve this goal, a company uses marketing resources (e.g. marketing campaigns), which are usually expensive. Design/methodology/approach This paper proposes a formal model of the Customer Life Value problem inspired by the uncapacitated facility location problem. Findings The computational experiments conducted by the authors illustrate the potential of the approach when compared with a standard (non-algorithm-supported) one. Originality/value The approach leads up to the economic trade-off between the volume of the employed resources and the aggregated CLV, i.e. the higher the number of resources utilized, but also the higher the cost of achieving this level of lifetime value. Hence, the number of resources to be activated has to be decided, and the effect of each of these resources on each CLV will depend upon how close the resource is from the corresponding customer (i.e. how large will the impact of the active resource on the customer).",

Within this context, opinion mining and sentiment analysis in marketing communications (OMSAMC) has a strong role in the development of the field by allowing us to understand whether people are satisfied or dissatisfied with our service or product in order to subsequently analyze the strengths and weaknesses of those consumer experiences. To the best of our knowledge, there is no science mapping analysis covering the research about opinion mining and sentiment analysis in the MarCom ecosystem.

   "content": "The role of digital technologies, especially the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), increasingly become a key element of diverse interactions between brands and consumers. Homo Cyber Oeconomicus, one of the potential stages of ongoing consumer's evolution, lives between processes of dehumanization of the surrounding world and humanization of digital technologies. While remaining in a constant contact with smart devices, systems and algorithms, they are looking for new values and meanings, which are a metaphor of their desires, fears and behaviors. As a result, the digital ecosystem, as an attempt to combine the humanism idea with technologization processes, poses new challenges to companies/brands, both concerning the quality of interactions with an increasingly digital consumer and tools used in that process. Chatbots can prove to be an interesting solution here, as their spectrum of potential areas of implementation in business systematically increases. The paper attempts to identify the influence of chatbots on marketing taking into account their role in Human-to-Machine interaction process. A part of these considerations is of the character of philosophical discourse on the role of that technology in human life, which is a starting point for the presentation of preliminary assumptions for a model of consumer-chatbot interaction (digital technology) in marketing activity of companies/brands.",

   "content": "Organizations have cultural-cognitive and regulative as well as normative elements that impact their employees. Organizations, by definition, cannot achieve a pure, stable state and always go through various change processes, both incremental and radical changes. Moving from legacy business-to-business (B2B) relationship management to an artificial intelligence-based customer relationship management (AI-CRM) is a gradual but paradigm change. AI-CRM leverages intelligent systems to automate the B2B relationship activities where the decision can be taken automatically without any human intervention. Relationship management in the B2B segment is considered a strategic activity of an organization. Moving from legacy to AI-CRM to facilitate B2B relationship management activities is an important decision, and proper implementation of AI-CRM is a critical success parameter for an organization. This study combines institutional theory and the resource-based view (RBV) in B2B relationship management to understand how AI-CRM could impact the firm's performance with varied firm size, firm age, and industry type.",

Although being widely discussed academically, publicly and in policy debates, certain aspects of their research, development and application are completely ignored, namely the impact AI has on animals. Animals are affected by the research on and development of this technology since it partially relies on animal testing. In addition, AI is also being applied to improve monitoring and marketing of animals in an agricultural context. We argue that it is insufficient to exclude these aspects from debates around AI. In addition to the surveillance-applications on animals, which can be evaluated as impacting them negatively, AI applications, from which individual animals can benefit, do exist. These can primarily be found in nature and wildlife con-servation, as we point out at the end of the paper. By providing an overview on how these technologies are applied to animals and how this affects them, this paper aims to fill a previously existing research gap.",

In particular, by integrating the models such as association rule, frequency matrix, and tree-based models (CHAID, CART, QUEST, C5.0), this study suggests an integrative prediction model. The data set for the tests is collected from a convenience store G, which is the number one in its brand in S. Korea. This data set contains sales information on customer transactions from September 1, 2005 to December 7, 2005. About 1000 transactions are selected for a specific item. Using this data set, it suggests an integrated model predicting whether a customer buys or does not buy a specific product for target marketing strategy. The performance of integrated model is compared with that of other models. The results from the experiments show that the performance of integrated model is superior to that of all other models such as association rule, frequency matrix, and tree-based models.

Still considered a nascent field of research without solid theoretical frameworks, practitioners are moving ahead championing social innovation to solve problems in society. But how are they communicating the message in the digital age? In this paper I examine the role of narrative marketing in promoting social businesses and explore the importance of narrative generation by using new technologies and media platforms for engaging clients and stakeholders to join the social movement. Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms being employed by digital communication platforms is changing content marketing by targeting user's background and interests directly. Thanks to big data and analytics, real-time personalization and machine learning techniques, AI is rethinking communication strategies and creating a significant impact with prospects of future ground-breaking innovations to enhance customer searches and influence consumer behaviors. This exploratory study is based on critical examination of secondary data, literature review and relevant case studies. The research questions are: how can narrative marketing engage people to join the social movement in the age of social media, digitization, and new technologies of the future? What is the role of emotion in narrative marketing in the light of technological transformations? Why is narrative marketing important to the future of organizations and their survival in a world of attention scarcity due to information overload (infoxication)? After conducting a theoretical analysis, I am presenting a few case studies encountered during a limited field observation and present the implications for practitioners on how to best market and communicate their stories to engage the stakeholders in a digitized world.",

This article addresses this research gap. It offers a literature overview and reports about an empirical study on AI in communications, presenting first insights on how professionals in the field assess the technology. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative cross-national study among 2,689 European communication practitioners investigated four research questions: RQ1 - How much do professionals know about AI and to what extent are they already using AI technologies in their everyday lives? RQ2 - How do professionals rate the impact of AI on communication management? RQ3 - Which challenges do professionals identify for implementing AI in communication management? RQ4 - Which risks do they perceive? Findings Communication professionals revealed a limited understanding of AI and expected the technology to impact the profession as a whole more than the way their organisations or themselves work. Lack of individual competencies and organisations struggling with different levels of competency and unclear responsibilities were identified as key challenges and risks. Research limitations/implications The results highlight the need for communication managers to educate themselves and their teams about the technology and to identify the implementation of AI as a leadership issue. Originality/value The article offers the first cross-national quantitative study on AI in communication management. It presents valuable empirical insights on a trending topic in the discipline, highly relevant for both academics and practitioners.",

This study aims to explore the characteristics of tourism AI start-ups, the AI technological domains financed by Venture Capitalists (VCs), and the phases of the supply chain where the AI domains are in high demand. Design/methodology/approach This study developed a database of the European AI start-ups operating in the TTI from the Crunchbase database (2005-2020). The authors used start-ups as the unit of analysis as they often foster radical change. The authors complemented quantitative and qualitative methods. Findings AI start-ups have been mainly created by male Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics graduates between 2015 and 2017. The number of founders and previous study experience in non-start-up companies was positively related to securing a higher amount of funding. European AI start-ups are concentrated in the capital town of major tourism destinations (France, UK and Spain). The AI technological domains that received more funding from VCs were Learning, Communication and Services (i.e. big data, machine learning and natural language processing), indicating a strong interest in AI solutions enabling marketing automation, segmentation and customisation. Furthermore, VC-backed AI solutions focus on the pre-trip and post-trip. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study focussing on digital entrepreneurship, specifically VC-backed AI start-ups operating in the TTI. The authors apply, for the first time, a mixed-method approach in the study of tourism entrepreneurship.",

   "content": "Organizations in the business of Information Services deal with very large volumes of data which is collected from a variety of proprietary, as well as, public sources in multiple languages with different formats, naming conventions, and context. Mapping such data into enterprise master data for reporting and prediction is an effort-intensive, time-consuming process which is prone to errors. Machines cannot match these sources and map to master data accurately. Enterprises are eager to automate the human intensive tasks of data harmonization so that their resources can focus on finding the insights to drive the business. We undertook one such automation initiative for a global Market Research Major (MRM) and achieved a significant level of success leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The Automated Data Harmonization (ADH) solution has been a multi-step approach of Dictionary Matching, Fuzzy Text Similarity, and different Machine Learning techniques. It has been implemented on the Big Data stack for better performance and scalability. In order to streamline the overall business process, runtime rules and workflow has been implemented. The Proof of Concept has yielded an overall F-Score within the range of 82-93% depending on the variation of the dataset. The deployed version is continuing to deliver high accuracy and gained adoption as a core micro-service across the organization. The Business as Usual (BAU) cycle time has been reduced by 80% (from 14 days to 3 days). While the solution is unique and tailored to meet a set of specific business requirements, it can be extended for media metadata standardization across multiple devices, author name and citation resolution in scholarly journals, leads resolution in multi-channel marketing and ad campaigns etc.",

However, they have different concerns and focuses with regard to the new product design. Thus, these three processes are commonly conducted separately, leading to a sub-optimal and even sub-standard design. Such scenario indicates the need to incorporate the concerns of the three processes in the early stage of product design. However, no study has explored the incorporation of the concerns of the three processes into the product design. In this paper, an artificial intelligence (AI)-based methodology for integrating affective design, engineering, and marketing for defining design specifications of new products is proposed by which the concerns of the three processes can be considered simultaneously in the early design stage. The proposed methodology mainly involves development of customer satisfaction and cost models using fuzzy regression, generation of product utility functions using chaos-based fuzzy regression, formulation of a multi-objective optimization model and its solving using a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGAII). A case study was conducted for electric iron design to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

To achieve this goal, a rigorous examination of its foundational knowledge structure underpinning the construct is urgently required. Using co-citation analysis examining 151 SBE-related articles with 4038 citations over more than two decades (1994-2019), six knowledge fields deemed to have constitutive influence on SBE literature have been identified: atmospherics, product evaluation, sensory marketing, service marketing, experiential marketing and brand experience. Combining the results of a hierarchical cluster analysis and a metric multidimensional scaling analysis, the authors located three fundamental premises: (1) brand settings are arbiters of brand meaning; (2) the intrinsic processing of SBE involves the entrainment of exteroceptive and interoceptive processes; and (3) SBE outcomes are non-representational. At the end of the paper, these findings are organized into an integrative framework, highlighting research concerns and research gaps at the antecedent, processing and outcome stages. In doing so, this paper contributes to the conceptual development of SBE by constructing a doctrinal schema for future research undertakings.",

   "content": "Knowledge-based information systems are advanced tools in the hands of the marketer, enabling him to take evidence-based decisions in complex situations. In this paper, advanced data analysis, neural networks and knowledge representation technologies are brought together towards an intelligent information system for tourist destination marketing. In previous work, knowledge engineering methods were proposed for the extraction and modeling from market survey data of factors, associations, clusters and hidden patterns that explain a market phenomenon or customer behavior. The feasibility of managing these findings in a Knowledge-Base, as reusable, sharable and machine understandable knowledge was shown using preliminary results from primary surveys on the tourism of Thessaloniki. In the current work, we present the continuation of these developments, including: (a) the final results of the survey on the tourism of Thessaloniki, (b) a refined Knowledge Base filled with real and validated content derived from the analysis of the full-scale survey data, (c) the extension of the methods with an artificial neural network classifier and (d) the deployment of an inference engine and a query mechanism in order to exercise the knowledge content for decision support. Pilot trials showed that the intelligent system was able to assist users who are not experts in analysis to solve typical destination marketing problems. (C) 2015 The Authors.

   "content": "To be competitive in contemporary turbulent environments, firms must be capable of processing huge amounts of information, and effectively convert it into actionable knowledge. This is particularly the case in the marketing context, where problems are also usually highly complex, unstructured and ill-defined. In recent years, the development of marketing management support systems has paralleled this evolution in informational problems faced by managers, leading to a growth in the study (and use) of artificial intelligence and soft computing methodologies. Here, we present and implement a novel intelligent system that incorporates fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms to operate in an unsupervised manner. This approach allows the discovery of interesting association rules, which can be linguistically interpreted, in large scale databases (KDD or Knowledge Discovery in Databases.) We then demonstrate its application to a distribution channel problem. It is shown how the proposed system is able to return a number of novel and potentially-interesting associations among variables. Thus, it is argued that our method has significant potential to improve the analysis of marketing and business databases in practice, especially in non-programmed decisional scenarios, as well as to assist scholarly researchers in their exploratory analysis.

   "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine learning (ML) systems in medicine are poised to significantly improve health care, for example, by offering earlier diagnoses of diseases or recommending optimally individualized treatment plans. However, the emergence of AI/ML in medicine also creates challenges, which regulators must pay attention to. Which medical AI/ML-based products should be reviewed by regulators? What evidence should be required to permit marketing for AI/ML-based software as a medical device (SaMD)? How can we ensure the safety and effectiveness of AI/ML-based SaMD that may change over time as they are applied to new data? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for example, has recently proposed a discussion paper to address some of these issues. But it misses an important point: we argue that regulators like the FDA need to widen their scope from evaluating medical AI/ML-based products to assessing systems. This shift in perspective-from a product view to a system view-is central to maximizing the safety and efficacy of AI/ML in health care, but it also poses significant challenges for agencies like the FDA who are used to regulating products, not systems. We offer several suggestions for regulators to make this challenging but important transition.",

   "content": "Case-based reasoning (CBR) often shows significant promise for improving the effectiveness of complex and unstructured decision-making. Consequently, it has been applied to various problem-solving areas including manufacturing, finance and marketing. However, the design of appropriate case indexing and retrieval mechanisms to improve the performance of CBR is still a challenging issue. Most previous studies on improving the effectiveness of CBR have focused on the similarity function aspect or optimization of case features and their weights. However, according to some of the prior research, finding the optimal k parameter for the k-nearest neighbor is also crucial for improving the performance of the CBR system. Nonetheless, there have been few attempts to optimize the number of neighbors, especially using artificial intelligence techniques. In this study, we introduce a genetic algorithm to optimize the number of neighbors that combine, as well as the weight of each feature. The new model is applied to the real-world case of a major telecommunication company in Korea in order to build a prediction model for customer profitability level. Experimental results show that our genetic-algorithm-optimized CBR approach outperforms other artificial intelligence techniques for this multi-class classification problem.",

Therefore, to know the needs of customers and to predict customer behaviors are very important for competition in the banking sector. Data mining uncovers relationships and hidden patterns in large data sets. Classification algorithms, one of the applications of data mining, is used very effectively in decision making. In this study, the c4.5 algorithm, a decision trees algorithm widely used in classification problems, is used in an integrated way with the ensemble machine learning methods in order to increase the efficiency of the algorithms. Data obtained via direct marketing campaigns from Portugal Banks was used to classify whether customers have term deposit accounts or not. Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines as Traditional Artificial Intelligence Methods and Bagging-C4.5 and Boosted-C.45 as ensemble-decision tree hybrid methods were used in classification. Bagging-C4.5 as ensemble-decision tree algorithm achieved more powerful classification success than other used algorithms. The ensemble-decision tree hybrid methods give better results than artificial neural networks and support vector machines as traditional artificial intelligence methods for this study.",

As a result of these developments, there is an increasing need for data-based or data-driven methods of model development. This paper describes data-driven classification methods and shows that the automatic development and refinement of decision support models is now possible when the machine is given a large (or sometimes even a small) amount of observations that express instances of a certain task domain. The classifier obtained may be used to build a decision support system, to refine or update an existing system and to understand or improve a decision-making process. The described AI classification methods are compared with statistical classification methods for a marketing application. They can act as a basis for data-driven decision support systems that have two basic components: an automated knowledge module and an advice module or, in different terms, an automated knowledge acquisition/retrieval module and a knowledge processing module. When these modules are integrated or linked, a decision support system can be created which enables an organization to make better-quality decisions, with reduced variance, probably using fewer people.

Not only affecting the lungs but also provoking acute respiratory distress, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is able to infect multiple cell types including cardiac and vascular cells. Hence a significant proportion of infected patients develop cardiac events, such as arrhythmias and heart failure. Patients with cardiovascular comorbidities are at highest risk of cardiac death. To face the pandemic and limit its burden, health authorities have launched several fast-track calls for research projects aiming to develop rapid strategies to combat the disease, as well as longer-term projects to prepare for the future. Biomarkers have the possibility to aid in clinical decision-making and tailoring healthcare in order to improve patient quality of life. The biomarker potential of circulating RNAs has been recognized in several disease conditions, including cardiovascular disease. RNA biomarkers may be useful in the current COVID-19 situation. The discovery, validation, and marketing of novel biomarkers, including RNA biomarkers, require multi-centre studies by large and interdisciplinary collaborative networks, involving both the academia and the industry. Here, members of the EU-CardioRNA COST Action CA17129 summarize the current knowledge about the strain that COVID-19 places on the cardiovascular system and discuss how RNA biomarkers can aid to limit this burden. They present the benefits and challenges of the discovery of novel RNA biomarkers, the need for networking efforts, and the added value of artificial intelligence to achieve reliable advances.",

Following this, the domain of retail can be sketched as a natural fit for the application of AI tools, which are known for their high proportion of human work and concurrent low profit margins. This paper aims to explore the current dissemination of the application of AI within the industry. The value-added core tasks of retail companies are examined to determine the possible utilization and the market adoption within the globally largest retail companies is given. Design/methodology/approach The paper uses two different approaches to identify the scientific state-of-the-art: a search on the major scientific databases and an empirical study of the ten largest international retail companies and their adoption of AI technologies in the domains of wholesale and retail. Findings The application within the different value-added core tasks varies greatly depending on the area. In summary, there are numerous possible applications in all areas. Especially, in areas where future forecasts are needed within the task areas (such as marketing or replenishment), the use of AI, today, is both scientifically and practically highly developed. In contrast, the market adoption of AI is highly variable. The pioneers have integrated extensive applications into everyday business, while the challengers are investing heavily in new initiatives. Some others, however, show neither active use nor any effort to adopt such technology. Originality/value To the best of the author's knowledge, this is one of the first research contributions to analyze the areas of application and the impact of AI structured along the value-added core processes of retail companies.",

The use of digital technologies, interactive systems, virtual assistants, self-advertisement, and motion design provided for more comprehensive research methods, fundamental scientific approaches, collaboration with exact natural sciences in the brand promotion system. Today, web consumer behavior patterns are studied and monitored by a unique system of neural networks. The issues of applying neural technologies in various human activities are becoming particularly relevant and, in a way, getting a new growth stage due to the active extension of artificial intelligence developments. Changes in the communication sphere and its digitalization are also links in this process. Modern researchers are not only interested in artificial intellectual platforms, but also in the possible development of human intelligence, the uniqueness of the mental activity, as well as the technologies that would allow one to see directly the entire activity process, visible responses of the human brain, and its neural connection. State-of-the-art artificial intelligence technologies and specially developed software for digital communications of the source and target groups on the web allow us to compare, correlate the body response to external stimuli with the processes in the neural network. The development of neural networks is the driving force for the communication sphere. Neural networks can analyze and correctly apply the data on target groups in the digital marketing communications system and produce over a thousand product solutions, which serve microsegments of target groups in a spot manner, can track the customer journey in all sales channels, and the algorithm will also choose where and when to place a message and how many times it should appear in the customer's field of vision. Neural technologies come to the fore in marketing communications allowing one to identify the true (not filtered by consciousness) responses of a potential consumer to various marketing materials. Tools are needed to analyze a vast base of personal data, the volume of which is constantly growing and should be processed. Due to the digitalization of marketing communications activities, many functions of marketing experts are gradually moving into the function of the software implemented by neural network technologies. The fact that the target product began to be promoted in a more tailored and effective manner is linked with the digitalization of communications, the use of psychophysiological methods implemented in neuromarketing. This research studies digital forms of advertising and consumer responses to advertising-graphic content using a complex of traditional and neuromarketing techniques. The object of research is digital content of telecommunication brands.",

   "content": "The popularity and application of artificial intelligence (AI) are increasing rapidly all around the world-where, in simple terms, AI is a technology which mimics the behaviors commonly associated with human intelligence. Today, various AI applications are being used in areas ranging from marketing to banking and finance, from agriculture to healthcare and security, from space exploration to robotics and transport, and from chatbots to artificial creativity and manufacturing. More recently, AI applications have also started to become an integral part of many urban services. Urban artificial intelligences manage the transport systems of cities, run restaurants and shops where every day urbanity is expressed, repair urban infrastructure, and govern multiple urban domains such as traffic, air quality monitoring, garbage collection, and energy. In the age of uncertainty and complexity that is upon us, the increasing adoption of AI is expected to continue, and so its impact on the sustainability of our cities. This viewpoint explores and questions the sustainability of AI from the lens of smart and sustainable cities, and generates insights into emerging urban artificial intelligences and the potential symbiosis between AI and a smart and sustainable urbanism. In terms of methodology, this viewpoint deploys a thorough review of the current status of AI and smart and sustainable cities literature, research, developments, trends, and applications. In so doing, it contributes to existing academic debates in the fields of smart and sustainable cities and AI. In addition, by shedding light on the uptake of AI in cities, the viewpoint seeks to help urban policymakers, planners, and citizens make informed decisions about a sustainable adoption of AI.",

Hence, this pioneering study proposes a two-stage AI deep-learning method for mitigation of the quality risk posed to O2O omnichannel operations by O2O food dissimilarity, and investigates what information should be disclosed online to minimize the gap between O2O consumer expectations and perceptions, based on information theory and expectation-confirmation theory. Its empirical results reveal, first, that the proposed method can successfully assess the similarity between offline versions of products and the online images utilized for marketing them; and second, that restaurants can use food-similarity records to determine which online food marketing images are most likely to achieve positive expectation confirmation. Lastly, it recommends that online food platforms include multiple, varied images of most heterogeneous foods, as a further means of avoiding O2O dissimilarity problems.",

   "content": "The local laboratory with a local client-base, that never needs to exchange information with any outside entity, is a dying breed. As marketing channels, animal movement, and reporting requirements become increasingly national and international, the need to communicate about laboratory tests and results grows. Local and proprietary names of laboratory tests often fail to communicate enough detail to distinguish between similar tests. To avoid a lengthy description of each test, laboratories need the ability to assign codes that, although not sufficiently user-friendly for day-to-day use, contain enough information to translate between laboratories and even languages. The Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) standard provides such a universal coding system. Each test-each atomic observation-is evaluated on 6 attributes that establish its uniqueness at the level of clinical-or epidemiologic-significance. The analyte detected, analyte property, specimen, and result scale combine with the method of analysis and timing (for challenge and metabolic type tests) to define a unique LOINC code. Equipping laboratory results with such universal identifiers creates a world of opportunity for cross-institutional data exchange, aggregation, and analysis, and presents possibilities for data mining and artificial intelligence on a national and international scale. A few challenges, relatively unique to regulatory veterinary test protocols, require special handling.",

The Internet has radically changed the business scenario wherein people have become the media for collaborating to share information. Practitioners have started using electronic word of mouth (eWOM) for consumer insight through text analytics, sentiment, hashtag analytics, and other machine learning tools. Due to the growing importance of the topic as a research area, it is vital to map the research domain. This paper uses performance analysis tools (quantitative and qualitative) and science mapping tools (conceptual and intellectual structures) for literature review and the identification of future research directions. The content analysis of emergent topics and themes offers directions for future researchers. Recommender systems, data mining (artificial intelligence and machine learning), semantics, and sentiment analysis are emergent topics. We contribute to the eWOM literature by canvassing state-of-the-art research and proposing future research directions. (C) 2020 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. dba Marketing EDGE.

   "content": "As artificial intelligence (AI) technology has advanced, it has become crucial to promoting service innovation and evolution. However, whether and when consumers prefer AI-enabled services remains unclear. This study addresses this question by investigating the matching effect of brand personality (sincerity vs. competence) and customer service provision type (human-staffed vs. AI-enabled) on brand attitudes and purchase intentions. Three scenario-based online experiments revealed that consumers prefer AI-enabled customer service when the brand personality is competence and human-staffed service when the brand personality is sincerity. These preferences lead to more positive brand attitudes and higher purchase intentions. We also found that perceived brand authenticity mediates the above relationships. Meanwhile, our investigation of the moderating role of consumer involvement found that the brand personality-service provision alignment's positive effects emerge for high-involvement consumers but not for low-involvement consumers. These findings contribute to brand personality and authenticity theory and have practical implications for companies' marketing strategies-elucidating, for example, how the effects of utilizing AI-enabled customer service may influence brand attitudes and purchase intentions regarding brands with different personalities.",

   "content": "Firms are developing AI-enhanced products (e.g., robots) that can tackle environmental problems through autonomous interactions with their surroundings (e.g., removing waste/pollutants, tracking invasive species) and autonomous learning, which results in improved environmental performance characteristics. Such autonomous environmental benefits of products differ from conventional, static environmental benefits, which derive from pre-purchase processes and design decisions. However, the literature still lacks knowledge of how to use such autonomous environmental benefits to attract new customers. Therefore, drawing on signaling theory, this study examines the effect of these environmental benefits on a consumer's purchase intent and its variation across types of consumers, locations, and products. Based on hierarchical linear modeling of 1635 consumer evaluations of AI-enhanced products, this study finds that both static and autonomous perceived environmental benefits influence purchase intent positively. The effect of autonomous environmental benefits is stronger for women than for men and for products targeted at adults rather than children. The effect of static environmental benefits is stronger for men than women, for products targeted at children rather than adults, for consumers with a higher need for cognition, and in locations with a higher perceived environmental well-being.

However, in the field of online consumer conversion, research is limited despite the high possibility of machine learning application due to the availability of big data. In this context, we investigate the following three research questions. First, what is the suitable machine learning model for predicting online consumer behavior? Second, what is the good data sampling method for predicting online con-sumer behavior? Third, can we interpret machine learning's online consumer behavior prediction results? We analyze 374,749 online consumer behavior data from Google Merchandise Store, an online shopping mall, and explore research questions. As a result of the empirical analysis, the performance of the ensemble model eXtreme Gradient Boosting model is most suitable for pre-dicting purchase conversion of online consumers, and oversampling is the best method to mitigate data imbalance bias. In addition, by applying explainable artificial intelligence methods to the context of retargeting advertisements, we investigate which consumers are effective in retargeting advertisements. This study theoretically contributes to the marketing and machine learning lit-erature by exploring and answering the problems that arise when applying machine learning models to predicting online consumer conversion. It also contributes to the online advertising literature by exploring consumer characteristics that are effective for retargeting advertisements.",

The knowledge content and relevant models of concrete enterprises are proposed, including advanced enterprise management, decision support for production operation, production and operation cost, and marketing-customer relationship. Afterwards knowledge contents are divided into static, strategic and reasoning knowledge. Besides knowledge unified expression is put forward accordingly. In addition, the KM system for process ready-mixed concrete enterprises management is established to facilitate effective production processing. As part of exploratory study, artificial neural network coupled with genetic algorithm (ANN-GA) as knowledge mining technology is applied in KM system to predict the 28-day compressive strength in concrete enterprises. The results shows that compared to back-propagation artificial neural network, the convergence rate of ANN-GA algorithm has been significantly improved and almost all the relative errors of predicted compressive strength of concrete C30 are within 3 %. It not only confirms the validity of the models, but also proves that ANN-GA algorithm is an effective knowledge mining method applied in concrete industry.",

Luxembourg: Publications Office of the European Union. https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/94cb5fc8-473e-11e7-aea8-01aa75ed71a1/]. The study takes into account the potential for AI and 'Big Data' to provide more effective monitoring of the education system in real-time, but also considers the implications for fundamental human rights and freedoms of both teachers and learners. The analysis highlights a need to balance the benefits and risks as AI tools are developed, marketed and deployed. We conclude with a call to embed consideration of the benefits and risks of AI in education as technology tools into the development, marketing and deployment of these tools. There are questions around who - which body or organisation - should take responsibility for regulating AI in education, particularly since AI impacts not only data protection and privacy, but on fundamental rights in general. Given AI's global impact, it should be regulated at a trans-national level, with a global organisation such as the UN taking on this role.",

   "content": "In the age of automation and artificial intelligence, the need for sustainable entrepreneurship for job creation has significantly raised. For the development of sustainable entrepreneurship in recent years, business schools worldwide have recognised their roles, and started providing entrepreneurship education (EE). Due to being in emerging phase, the EE at business schools is following pedagogic approaches that are not exclusively developed for entrepreneurship, and hence, not suitable with the practical entrepreneurial needs. This leaves graduates lacking in many types of entrepreneurial skill-sets. One of those key skill-sets is entrepreneurial marketing (EM), which is one of the most dominating problems for SME entrepreneurs for the survival and growth of their businesses. Furthermore, the literature highlights that lack of EM skill-set is also one of the leading causes of entrepreneurial failure. The failure of SME entrepreneurs not only discourages them, but also damages the initiatives taken by the governments and private institutions for entrepreneurship development in the economies. Thus, considering the critical importance of EM education for the development of entrepreneurship, this paper has highlighted the pedagogical gaps in EM education, proposed future research avenues, and made practical implications for business schools' academic authorities to upgrade their pedagogical models.",

   "content": "In recent years, the use of pre-printed advertising inserts in newspapers has increased dramatically. Pre-printed inserts allow advertisers to deliver colorful, high-quality marketing material to targeted groups of consumers within the newspaper's delivery zone structure. To accommodate the increased workload associated with pre-printed inserts without negatively impacting the news deadline or delivery schedules, many newspaper companies face increasingly complex post-press scheduling decisions. This paper presents a spreadsheet model developed to represent the pre-printed insert scheduling problem in a case study of an actual medium-size newspaper company. The performance of two commercial genetic algorithm (GA) optimizers is compared on this problem. Computational testing shows the GAs develop schedules that substantially reduce the post-press production department's insert processing time. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

   "content": "Operational planning is the process of planning and organizing the resources to achieve organization's strategic plan. Planning the supply chain, maintenance, marketing, and production operations are the main parts of operational planning. The operational planning for energy investments is crucial since these investments are costly and the efficiency of the investments necessitates an ample planning process. Also, the type of energy source changes the operational planning need. Understanding these needs and the research gaps can enhance the efficiency of the energy systems. The objective of this chapter is to reveal the primary needs and research focuses on operation planning in energy systems. A comprehensive literature review is conducted to identify the research focuses and the gaps in operational planning in energy systems.",

   "content": "A customer's experience with a brand, as evidenced in online customer reviews, has attracted multidisciplinary scholarly attention. Customer experience plays an important role as an antecedent to brand engagement, brand adoption, and eventual brand loyalty. Thus, it is important for businesses to understand their customers' experiences so that they can make changes as necessary. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented changes to the business landscape, forcing businesses to move online, with many utilizing enterprise video conferencing (EVC) to maintain daily operations. To ensure efficient digitization, many turned to the online reviews of others' experiences with EVC before engaging with it themselves. This research examined how the customer experience is portrayed through emotional tone and word choice in online reviews for the EVC platform Zoom. Using computerized text analysis, key differences were found in the emotional tone and word choice for low- and high-rated reviews. The complexity and emotionality expressed in reviews have implications on the usability of the review for others. The results from this study suggest that online customer reviews with a high rating express a higher level of expertise and confidence than low-rated reviews. Given the potential dissemination and impact, digital marketers may be well advised to first and foremost respond to online reviews that are high in emotional tone.",

As a result, there is a growing interest in understanding the nature of variations in consumer's consumption. This information can be used to facilitate electricity supplier in their marketing strategy. Thus, it is essential to have typical load profiles of different groups of consumers. Many techniques for consumers' classification have been reported in the past. The techniques include applications of statistics, unsupervised clustering technique and methods based on frequency domain approach. This paper examined the capability of artificial intelligent techniques to classify electricity consumers by their pattern of consumption. Fuzzy clustering and artificial neural network (ANN) has been employed in this study. Results obtained demonstrate the ability of the proposed method in classifying consumer by their energy consumption.",

The fuzzy preference is related to decision making in artificial intelligence, and this paper models human behavior based on his aggregated fuzzy preferences. To deal with fuzzy preferences in dynamic decision making brings us difficulty which is different from static one since the value criterion of fuzzy preferences in dynamic behavior transforms together with time and it is formulated gradually. A reasonable criterion based on fuzzy preferences is formulated for the dynamic decision making, and an optimality equation for this model is derived by dynamic programming. Mathematical models simulating human behavior with his decision making are applicable to various fields: robotics, customers' behavior analysis in marketing, linguistic learning modeling, multi-agent systems and so on.",

We examined, in a banking services context, whether consumers preferred AI or Human online customer service applications using an experimental design across three field-based experiments. The results show that, in the case of low-complexity tasks, consumers considered the problem-solving ability of AI to be greater than that of human customer service and were more likely to use AI while, conversely, for high-complexity tasks, they viewed human customer service as superior and were more likely to use it than AI. Moreover, we found that perceived problem-solving ability mediated the effects of customers' service usage intentions (i.e., their preference for AI vs. Human) with task complexity serving as a boundary condition. Here we discuss our research and the results and conclude by offering practical suggestions for banks seeking to reach customers and engage with them more effectively by leveraging the distinctive features of AI customer service.

   "Author Keywords": "artificial intelligence; chatbot; creepiness; loyalty; privacy concerns; privacy paradox; technology paradox",
   "content": "Consumers sometimes describe their experience of interacting with artificial intelligence-based human-like chatbots as creepy. This study investigates the antecedents of creepiness (i.e., the chatbot's usability, privacy concerns, and user variables such as technology anxiety and the need for human interaction) and its impact on consumer loyalty. Grounded in the technology paradox, it deepens the understanding of creepiness in light of the theoretical underpinnings of the privacy paradox and privacy cynicism. Presented with the task of obtaining a car insurance quote, 430 consumers participated in a simulation involving interaction with a chatbot, followed by a questionnaire. The findings show that creepiness decreases loyalty and indirectly impacts it through trust and negative emotions. While usability reduces perceptions of creepiness, privacy concerns raised by the interaction with the chatbot increase creepiness, which is positively associated with consumer traits (i.e., technology anxiety and need for human interaction). The main contribution of the research lies in its focus on creepiness, a concept under-researched in the marketing literature, and which can be seen from the perspective of a coping mechanism for consumers' privacy concerns. This paper provides practical implications to orient managers in the design and implementation of chatbots, as a promising touch point to build customer loyalty.",

This article explores the development of user generated content and specifically the use of web logs or blogs. Tourism organisations cannot afford to ignore the development of user generated content, peer-to-peer web applications and virtual communities. A recent survey found that consumers trusted more websites with reviews than professional guides and travel agencies and far from being an irrelevance, blogs are often perceived to be more credible and trustworthy than traditional marketing communications. But there is a problem: given the sheer number of possibly relevant travel blogs there is a need to locate, extract and interpret blog content and this has proven so far to be time consuming, exhausting and costly, thus negating the relative value of the information obtained. A way forward may be the use of artificial intelligence and opinion mining'' or a blog visualisation system.",

   "content": "Using a proprietary database of online job postings from 2010 to 2019, we find that job vacancies in the U.S. energy sector increasingly require high levels of soft skills (such as social, cognitive, people management, project management, and customer service skill), showing an upskilling pattern in the past decade. We further examine skill requirements across and within four major professional occupations in the U.S. energy sector and find substantial variations. Meanwhile, in the energy sector, although cognitive and social skills are the most frequently required skills, they do not positively contribute to firm productivity. Although the requirement for hard skills (such as products and marketing, engineering, and general computer skill) stays relatively flat, hard skills actually matter most in the energy sector, especially products and marketing and general computer skills are two most valuable skills, contributing the highest to energy firms. Our results indicate that energy firms should pay more attention to hard skills in human resource management, while not following the increasing trend of soft skills in hiring.",

Our study, which focuses on the customer and his/her declarative psychological responses to an interaction with a virtual assistant, will fill a gap in the digital marketing research, where little attention has been paid to the impact of Error and Gender, as well as the extent to which Social Presence and Perceived Competence mediate the relationships between Anthropomorphic design cues and Trust. We provide consistent evidence of the significant negative effect of erroneous conversational interfaces on several constructs considered in our conceptual model, such as: perceived competence, trust, as well as positive consumer responses. We also provide support to previous research findings and confirm that people employ a biased thinking across gender and this categorization also influences their acceptance of chatbots taking social roles. The results of an empirical study demonstrated that highly anthropomorphized female chatbots that engage in social behaviors are significantly shaping positive consumer responses, even in the error condition. Moreover, female virtual assistants are much more commonly forgiven when committing errors compared to male chatbots.",

A major trend evident at the workshop was the transition to applications in the core KDD area of discovery of relatively simple patterns in relational databases; the most successful applications are appearing in the areas of greatest need, where the databases are so large that manual analysis is impossible. Progress has been facilitated by the availability of commercial KDD tools for both generic discovery and domain-specific applications such as marketing. At the same time, progress has been slowed by problems such as lack of statistical rigor, overabundance of patterns, and poor integration. Besides applications, the main themes of this workshop were (1) the discovery of dependencies and models and (2) integrated and interactive KDD systems.",

   "content": "Many problems in artificial intelligence require adaptively making a sequence of decisions with uncertain outcomes under partial observability. Solving such stochastic optimization problems is a fundamental but notoriously difficult challenge. In this paper, we introduce the concept of adaptive submodularity, generalizing submodular set functions to adaptive policies. We prove that if a problem satisfies this property, a simple adaptive greedy algorithm is guaranteed to be competitive with the optimal policy. In addition to providing performance guarantees for both stochastic maximization and coverage, adaptive submodularity can be exploited to drastically speed up the greedy algorithm by using lazy evaluations. We illustrate the usefulness of the concept by giving several examples of adaptive submodular objectives arising in diverse AI applications including management of sensing resources, viral marketing and active learning. Proving adaptive submodularity for these problems allows us to recover existing results in these applications as special cases, improve approximation guarantees and handle natural generalizations.",

The chatbot is a platform that uses natural language processing, a subset of artificial intelligence, to find the right answer to all users' questions and solve their problems. Advanced chatbot architecture that is extensible, scalable, and supports different services for natural language understanding (NLU) and communication channels for interactions of users has been proposed. The paper describes overall chatbot architecture and provides corresponding metamodels as well as rules for mapping between the proposed and two commonly used NLU metamodels. The proposed architecture could be easily extended with new NLU services and communication channels. Finally, two implementations of the proposed chatbot architecture are briefly demonstrated in the case study of ADA and COVID-19 Info Serbia.",

This paper models human behavior based on the aggregated fuzzy preferences, and an objective function induced from the fuzzy preferences is formulated. In dynamic decision making, there exists a difficulty when we formulate the objective function from fuzzy preferences since the value criterion of fuzzy preferences in dynamic behavior transforms together with time and it is formulated gradually based on the experience. A reasonable criterion based on fuzzy preferences is formulated for the dynamic decision making, and an optimality equation for this model is derived by dynamic programming. Mathematical models to simulate human behavior with his decision making are applicable to various fields: robotics, customers' behavior analysis in marketing, multi-agent systems and so on.",

Therefore, this study proposes centralized and decentralized versions of the game, comparing their solutions under static and dynamic settings. Moreover, it investigates the decentralized supply chain by evaluating two smart contracts: Revenue sharing and wholesale price contracts. In both cases, the firms use an artificial intelligence system to determine the optimal contract parameters. Numerical and qualitative analyses are used for comparing configurations (centralized, decentralized), settings (static, dynamic), and contract schemes (revenue sharing contract, wholesale price contract). The findings identify the conditions under which smart revenue sharing mechanisms are worth applying.",

   "content": "Purpose - The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationships that influence the value co-creation process and lead to consumer comfort with artificial intelligence (AI) and mobile banking (AIMB) service platforms. Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual model was developed to investigate the value-in-use perceptions of AI-based mobile banking applications via five antecedents: baseline perceptions of current bank service delivery; service delivery configuration benefits; general data security; safety perceptions of specific mobile banking services; and perceptions of AI service delivery. Data were collected from 218 respondents and analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings - This study highlights the role and importance of the sequential relationships that impact the assessment of AIMB. The findings suggest that service delivery and the customer's role in value co-creation change as AI is introduced into a digital self-service technology channel. Furthermore, AIMB offers transaction-oriented (utilitarian) value propositions more so than relationship-oriented (hedonic) value propositions. Research limitations/implications - The sample consisted on digital natives. Additional age cohorts are needed. Practical implications - As financial institutions redirect their business models toward digital self-service technology channels, the need for customers to feel comfortable while interacting with an AI agent will be critical for enhancing the customer experience and firm performance. Originality/value - The authors extend the service-dominant logic (SDL) literature by showing that value co-creation is a function of both firms' technologies and consumers' value-in-use, a finding that appears to be unique in the literature. The authors advance the digital transformation literature by evaluating AIMB as an interactive process that requires an understanding of key technology constructs, including perceptions of baseline service relationships, desired service configurations, security and safety issues and whether AI is useful for value co-creation. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first SDL framework that investigates interactive and structural relationships to explain value-in-use perceptions of AIMB.",

The next step is to adopt the best of the international ideas, trends and approaches which are shaping the future of pharmacovigilance. Specifically: 1) The risk management approach requires proactively preventing or minimizing risks, starting in early clinical development and extending all along the lifecycle of a pharmaceutical. 2) Drug safety is a multidisciplinary discipline where all stakeholders should be involved. 3) Clinical trials provide an ideal safety profile limited to the restrictive conditions of the trial. Only real-world data, from the post marketing period, will reveal the real risk/benefit balance for the use of a pharmaceutical in regular clinical care. 4) Artificial intelligence is needed to analyze the large amount of data collected through the post-marketing studies, electronic medical records and the internet. Many AI tools have been developed to support better use of pharmaceuticals. 5) Quality-oriented, thorough inspections and audits are critical for achieving patient safety. 6) Patients should be recognized as active players in their treatment who can, and should, have access to safety information through the major agencies' websites.Israel can benefit from several of its key assets to reach a higher level of pharmacovigilance: 1) Israel's four HMOs are organized in a way that allows them to have quick and efficient dialogue with healthcare professionals and with patients. Moreover, a new project named, Big Data in Health, will pool the epidemiologic databases of the HMOs, providing precious information for understanding risk factors, detecting alerts, and developing personalized medicine. 2) Formal risk management activities have long been part of the culture of hospitals and should be applied increasingly to ensuring drug safety.Israel has the organizational, scientific, technological and cultural resources needed to quickly overcome the challenges and go beyond its current state to build a unique pharmacovigilance system which could serve as an example for other countries.",

A between-subjects experiment examined the effects of the type of relationship (virtual assistantship versus virtual friendship) consumers build with AI-enabled chatbots on brand personality perception, parasocial interaction (PSI), and CRM. The main effects of the relationship type on brand personality perception appeared for competent brand personality, but not for sincere brand personality. The consumer-chatbot relationship type had effects on CRM-related outcomes (behavioral intention, satisfaction, and trust) through competent brand personality. Consumers who interacted with a friend chatbot experienced stronger PSI with the chatbot, and the relationship type had an influence on brand personality perception through PSI. This mediating effect of PSI was observed for both brand personalities -competence and sincerity. The moderating role of ideological views (technopians versus luddites) in explaining the effect of the relationship type on brand personality perception was detected for sincere brand personality. AI designers and marketers need to develop AI user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) along with marketing strategies that not only can appeal to technopians ready to adopt innovative AI customer representatives but also can ultimately help alle-viate luddites?

   "content": "This article presents an artificial intelligence-based solution to the problem of product line optimization. More specifically, we apply a new hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach to design an optimal industrial product line. PSO is a biologically-inspired optimization framework derived from natural intelligence that exploits simple analogues of collective behavior found in nature, such as bird flocking and fish schooling. All existing product line optimization algorithms in the literature have been so far applied to consumer markets and product attributes that range across some discrete values. Our hybrid PSO algorithm searches for an optimal product line in a large design space which consists of both discrete and continuous design variables. The incorporation of a mutation operator to the standard PSO algorithm significantly improves its performance and enables our mechanism to outperform the state of the art Genetic Algorithm in a simulated study with artificial datasets pertaining to industrial cranes. The proposed approach deals with the problem of handling variables that can take any value from a continuous range and utilizes design variables associated with both product attributes and value-added services. The application of the proposed artificial intelligence framework yields important implications for strategic customer relationship and production management in business-to-business markets.

In this systematic review, we describe the various areas within clinical medicine that have applied the use of ML to improve patient care. Methods: A systematic review was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines using Medline(R), EBM Reviews, Embase, Psych Info, and Cochrane Databases, focusing on human studies that used ML to directly address a clinical problem. Included studies were published from January 1, 2000 to May 1, 2018 and provided metrics on the performance of the utilized ML tool. Results: A total of 1909 unique publications were reviewed, with 378 retrospective articles and 8 prospective articles meeting inclusion criteria. Retrospective publications were found to be increasing in frequency, with 61 % of articles published within the last 4 years. Prospective articles comprised only 2 % of the articles meeting our inclusion criteria. These studies utilized a prospective cohort design with an average sample size of 531. Conclusion: The majority of literature describing the use of ML in clinical medicine is retrospective in nature and often outlines proof-of-concept approaches to impact patient care. We postulate that identifying and overcoming key translational barriers, including real-time access to clinical data, data security, physician approval of black box generated results, and performance evaluation will allow for a fundamental shift in medical practice, where specialized tools will aid the healthcare team in providing better patient care.",

However, framing resilient and correct smart contracts (SCs) for these smart application is a quite challenging task because of the complexity associated with them. SC is modernizing the traditional industrial, technical, and business processes. It is self-executable, self-verifiable, and embedded into the BC that eliminates the need for trusted third-party systems, which ultimately saves administration as well as service costs. It also improves system efficiency and reduces the associated security risks. However, SCs are well encouraging the new technological reforms in Industry 4.0, but still, various security and privacy challenges need to be addressed. In this paper, a survey on SC security vulnerabilities in the software code that can be easily hacked by a malicious user or may compromise the entire BC network is presented. As per the literature, the challenges related to SC security and privacy are not explored much by the authors around the world. From the existing proposals, it has been observed that designing a complex SCs cannot mitigate its privacy and security issues. So, this paper investigates various Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques and tools for SC privacy protection. Then, open issues and challenges for AI-based SC are analyzed. Finally, a case study of retail marketing is presented, which uses AI and SC to preserve its security and privacy.",

Many methods from various disciplines (industrial/design engineering, psychophysics, multi-criteria decision analysis, marketing, artificial intelligence, statistical analysis) presently contribute partially to support this design loop. But few methods propose an integrated and coherent framework to deal with this elementary conceptual design loop. In this article, we propose such a methodology which is a coherent combination of classical methods in psychophysics, marketing and decision theory, namely multidimensional scaling, semantic differential method, factor analysis, pairwise comparison and Analytical Hierarchy Process. Our approach provides designers with a tool which helps the definition of the semantic part of the need, it rates and ranks the new product prototypes according to their proximity to the ideal product, and it underlines the particular semantic dimensions that could be improved. To illustrate our approach, we have performed users' tests and applied our methodology to the design of table glasses. For clarity, each stage of the methodology is presented in detail on this particular example.",

   "content": "Between the dawn of the Internet through year 2003, there were just a few dozens exabytes of information on the Web. Today, that much information is created weekly. The opportunity to capture the opinions of the general public about social events, political movements, company strategies, marketing campaigns, and product preferences has raised increasing interest both in the scientific community, for the exciting open challenges, and in the business world, for the remarkable fallouts in marketing and financial prediction. Keeping up with the ever-growing amount of unstructured information on the Web, however, is a formidable task and requires fast and efficient models for opinion mining. In this paper, we explore how the high generalization performance, low computational complexity, and fast learning speed of extreme learning machines can be exploited to perform analogical reasoning in a vector space model of affective common-sense knowledge. In particular, by enabling a fast reconfiguration of such a vector space, extreme learning machines allow the polarity associated with natural language concepts to be calculated in a more dynamic and accurate way and, hence, perform better concept-level sentiment analysis.

   "content": "The worldwide adoption of mobile devices is raising the value of Mobile Performance Marketing, which is supported by Demand-Side Platforms (DSP) that match mobile users to advertisements. In these markets, monetary compensation only occurs when there is a user conversion. Thus, a key DSP issue is the design of a data-driven model to predict user conversion. To handle this nontrivial task, we propose a novel Multi-objective Optimization (MO) approach to evolve Decision Trees (DT) using a Grammatical Evolution (GE), under two main variants: a pure GE method (MGEDT) and a GE with Lamarckian Evolution (MGEDTL). Both variants evolve variable-length DTs and perform a simultaneous optimization of the predictive performance and model complexity. To handle big data, the GE methods include a training sampling and parallelism evaluation mechanism. The algorithms were applied to a recent database with around 6 million records from a real-world DSP. Using a realistic Rolling Window (RW) validation, the two GE variants were compared with a standard DT algorithm (CART), a Random Forest and a state-of-the-art Deep Learning (DL) model. Competitive results were obtained by the GE methods, which present affordable training times and very fast predictive response times.",

   "content": "Nowadays insurance industry has huge innovation potential. Several key vectors for developing the concept of insurance tech include machine learning, business analytics, consumer protection rules, Big Data, artificial intelligence, neural networks, blockchain, and telematics. Technological innovations become widespread only when a community that supports them emerges, and COVID-19 has rapidly accelerated the changes that were already in full swing to a greater extent than any other factor. COVID-19 has helped reinforce the story and ilustrate the results that technologies achieve on a large scale. Modern marketing and management approaches in insurance are viewed as an activity to optimize and control the insurance company's innovation and marketing activities. It would allow taking a strategicaly advantageous position in the insurance market. There are two kinds of insurance marketing: structural and commodity. Structural marketing could help to solve the problem of the economic efficiency of the activity of insurance companies. Commodity marketing helps to improve financial activity and, as a result, to increase profitability. This article summarizes the arguments and counterarguments within the scientific discussion on the place and prospects marketing and management in insurance (strategies, functions, principles) in the context of key innovation metrics. The study's primary purpose is to confirm the hypothesis about the functional link between the level of innovative development of the country and key insurance determinants as drivers for transformation in marketing strategies of insurance companies. In this regard, the array of input data is presented in the form of seven independent variables (regressors), six of which denote innovation measures, one is control variable, and five dependent variables (regressands), which identify the insurance sector. The study of the impact of innovation metrics on the insurance sector of the country in the article is carried out in the following logical sequence: 1) the formation of an array of input data; selection of relevant indicators using Principal Component Analysis; 2) formalization of functional relationships between variables by constructing five-panel Multifactor regression models with Random Effects; and 3) interpretation of the obtained results. Seventeen countries of Central and Eastern Europe were selected as the object of the study for the period from 2004 till 2019. The study empirically confirms the above hypothesis, which is evidenced by the following identified dependences. Key insurance determinants depend on innovation fluctuations. The most significant positive influence on the dependent variables is exercised by the Innovations index, Research and development expenditure, and Patent applications by residents. The study results could be helpful for insurance companies that provide new insurance technologies and seek to optimize activities to support innovative development. The main directions of marketing and management in insurance should be considered from two positions applying new technologies in insurance marketing and introducing new insurance products or services.",

   "content": "Recent years have seen unprecedented research on using artificial intelligence to understand the subjective attributes of images and videos. These attributes are not objective properties of the content but are highly dependent on the perception of the viewers. Subjective attributes are extremely valuable in many applications where images are tailored to the needs of a large group, which consists of many individuals with inherently different ideas and preferences. For instance, marketing experts choose images to establish specific associations in the consumers' minds, while psychologists look for pictures with adequate emotions for therapy. Unfortunately, most of the existing frameworks either focus on objective attributes or rely on large scale datasets of annotated images, making them costly and unable to clearly measure multiple interpretations of a single input. Meanwhile, we can see that users or organizations often interact with images in a multitude of real-life applications, such as the sharing of photographs by brands on social media or the re-posting of image microblogs by users. We argue that these aggregated interactions can serve as auxiliary information to infer image interpretations. To this end, we propose a probabilistic learning framework capable of transferring such subjective information to the image-level labels based on a known aggregated distribution. We use our framework to rank images by subjective attributes from the domain knowledge of social media marketing and personality psychology. Extensive studies and visualizations show that using auxiliary information is a viable line of research for the multimedia community to perform subjective attributes prediction.",

The relevance of foresight methodology application is justified. The paper's focus is on future trends of digital technologies by providing a brief literature review in the fields of digital technologies and relevant marketing resources. Key assumptions, expectations and uncertainties about the future are re-evaluated. It is justified that long-term thinking is crucial to frame future strategies not only for governments and citizens but also for both small and international companies. Three global trends within the field of digital technologies are investigated: artificial intelligence, block chain and big data. The marketing resources which are currently arising and developing with the highest potential of dominating and revolutionizing the future of marketing are described: internet of things, social media, virtual and augmented reality. The author used the example of augmented reality expansion and development as one of the most promising global trends. Survey methodology was applied to evaluate the potential of augmented reality (AR) application using one of the most promising international industry adopters: the tourism industry. The AR mobile apps generated $ 2 billion in revenue as of the end of 2016 and according to the investigations the AR market could grow to $ 120 billion by 2020. The research results have shown that 84% to 100% of generation Y & Z consumers, whose consumption patterns would shape future demand, see clear benefits in using augmented reality applications in tourism industry.",

   "content": "Purpose Big data analytics allows researchers and industry practitioners to extract hidden patterns or discover new information and knowledge from big data. Although artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the emerging big data analytics techniques, hospitality and tourism literature has shown minimal efforts to process and analyze big hospitality data through AI. Thus, this study aims to develop and compare prediction models for review helpfulness using machine learning (ML) algorithms to analyze big restaurant data. Design/methodology/approach The study analyzed 1,483,858 restaurant reviews collected from Yelp.com. After a thorough literature review, the study identified and added to the prediction model 4 attributes containing 11 key determinants of review helpfulness. Four ML algorithms, namely, multivariate linear regression, random forest, support vector machine regression and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were used to find a better prediction model for customer decision-making. Findings By comparing the performance metrics, the current study found that XGBoost was the best model to predict review helpfulness among selected popular ML algorithms. Results revealed that attributes regarding a reviewer's credibility were fundamental factors determining a review's helpfulness. Review helpfulness even valued credibility over ratings or linguistic contents such as sentiment and subjectivity. Practical implications The current study helps restaurant operators to attract customers by predicting review helpfulness through ML-based predictive modeling and presenting potential helpful reviews based on critical attributes including review, reviewer, restaurant and linguistic content. Using AI, online review platforms and restaurant websites can enhance customers' attitude and purchase decision-making by reducing information overload and search cost and highlighting the most crucial review helpfulness features and user-friendly automated search results. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, the current study is the first to develop a prediction model of review helpfulness and reveal essential factors for helpful reviews. Furthermore, the study presents a state-of-the-art ML model that surpasses the conventional models' prediction accuracy. The findings will improve practitioners' marketing strategies by focusing on factors that influence customers' decision-making.",

However, the burgeoning scholarship argues that there are ethical challenges relating to this new technology, not the least related to privacy, which affects the technology's acceptance. Given that the media impacts public opinion and acceptance of VA and that there are no studies on media coverage of VA, the study focuses on media coverage. In addition, this study aims to focus on media coverage in Indonesia, a country that has been underrepresented in earlier research. Design/methodology/approach The authors used critical discourse analysis of media texts, focusing on three levels (text, discourse practice and social practice) to study how VA technology was discussed in the Indonesian context and what power relations frame the representation. In total, 501 articles were collected from seven national media in Indonesia from 2010 to 2020 and the authors particularly focus on the 45 articles that concern ethics. Findings The ethical topics covered are gender issues, false marketing, ethical wrongdoing, ethically positive effects, misuse, privacy and security. More importantly, when they are discussed, they are presented as presenting no real critical problem. Regarding discursive practices, the media coverage is highly influenced by foreign media and most of the articles are directed to well-educated Indonesians. Finally, regarding social practices, the authors hold that the government ideology of technological advancement is related to this positive portrayal of VAs. Originality/value First, to provide the first media discourse study about ethical issues of VAs. Second, to provide insights from a non-Western context, namely, Indonesia, which is underrepresented in the research on ethics of VAs.",

In order to survive in a fiercely competitive environment and maintain their competitive advantages, the only way to continuously provide consumers with high-quality services is the key to the sustainable operation of modern enterprises. The purpose of this research is focusing on the impact of service quality for automotive aftermarket parts and customers' willingness to repurchase. In this study, 400 questionnaire invitations through e-mail were distributed to existing customers and 164 valid questionnaires were responded. The responded answers were encoded, filed, and verified using SPSS. Degree and validity analysis, narrative statistics, single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA), regression analysis and structural equation modeling were applied for analysis. Through empirical analysis, there are many findings: Sales Service & Marketing, R&D capabilities, and innovative services in service quality are positively and significantly related to customers' willingness to repurchase. In the single factor variation analysis and structural equations, it is found that the impact of customer type on service quality and customer repurchase intention is not significantly related. In this study, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was also applied to compare the impact of service quality and to build the prediction model for customer repurchasing. These AI techniques include decision tree, neural network models, and multiple-linear regression. It is concluded that Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have better predictive ability after training with sufficient data and proper input data. For decision tree and regression analysis, these models' predicting power will decrease when the data becomes more complex.",

It concentrates on the political processes in Russian Federation in the recent decades to figure out the most common trends and tendencies. We advocate that the usage of mathematical research methods represents a pathway for the rational studying and understanding of the political process. Recent events with the British company Cambridge Analytica that used big data approach and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to harvest users' data on Facebook with the purpose of building voters' profiles in accordance with the principles of Top 5 Personality features (also known as the OCEAN model), show how important, yet dangerous and volatile the use of analytics might be in modern democracies. Even though, we do not have the same ambitions as the British political marketing company, our findings in the mathematical substantiation of the multiplicity of political parties and their effective number allow us to structure the political process in modern Russia and determine its main historical stages and trends.",

Given this, we introduce uplift modeling as a relevant prescriptive analytics tool. In particular, the uplift logit leaf model offers a segmentation-based algorithm that combines predictive performance with interpretability. Applied to a real-world data set of 6432 customers of a European software provider, the uplift logit leaf model achieves superior performance relative to three other popular uplift models in our study. The accessibility of output gained from the uplift logit leaf model also is showcased with a case study, which reveals relevant managerial insights. This new tool thus delivers novel insights in the form of customized, global, and segment-level visualizations that are especially pertinent to industrial marketing settings. Overall, the findings affirm the viability of uplift modeling for improving decisions related to B2B customer retention management.",

The automatic detection of gender in microblogs, like twitter, is a difficult task. It requires a system that can use knowledge to interpret the linguistic styles being used by the genders. In this paper, we try to provide this knowledge for such a system by considering different sets of features, which are relatively independent of the text, such as function words and part of speech n-grams. We test a range of different feature sets using two different classifiers; namely Na < ve Bayes and maximum entropy algorithms. Our results show that the gender detection task benefits from the inclusion of features that capture the authorial style of the microblog authors. We achieve an accuracy of approximately 71 %, which outperforms the classification accuracy of commercially available gender detection software like Gender Genie and Gender Guesser.",

The analysis of these textual contents for sentiments is a gold mine for marketing experts, thus automatic sentiment analysis is a popular area of applied artificial intelligence. We propose a latent syntactic structure-based approach for sentiment analysis which requires only sentence-level polarity labels for training. Our experiments on three domains (movie, IT products, restaurant) show that a sentiment analyzer that exploits syntactic parses and has access only to sentence-level polarity annotation for in-domain sentences can outperform state-of-the-art models that were trained on out-domain parse trees with sentiment annotation for each node of the trees. In practice, millions of sentence-level polarity annotations are usually available for a particular domain thus our approach is applicable for training a sentiment analyzer for a new domain while it can exploit the syntactic structure of sentences as well.",

Most of these systems use artificial intelligence techniques. Systems have been designed to address the problem of allocating the wealth of an individual across various assets in order to maximize return subject to a certain risk. This problem is known as the investment portfolio management problem. This problem can be comprised of the investment advisory problem and the portfolio allocation problem. This paper proposes an information system for the investment advisory problem to aid the wealth managers in providing regulatory compliant investment advice. The system considers the behavioral traits of the customer and calculates his risk appetite. It then does a risk scoring and allocates the wealth of the customer proportionately in different investment asset classes. It then checks the suitability of the advisory note prepared by the wealth manager subject to a set of inbuilt rules.",

   "content": "Short-term supply planning is concerned with the anticipation of sharp deviations in actual customer demand, resulting in unseen loading of manufacturing plants, within the MPS planning horizon. A high level of accuracy in master production scheduling is normally achieved by effective collaboration of the production, distribution, sales and marketing functions of manufacturing industries. However, attempts to guarantee 100% on-time delivery, while maintaining minimum finished goods inventory, can create sharp fluctuations in near-term demand (especially in a volatile market environment) signals received by manufacturing plants. This paper presents a prototype supply planning system, which can be used to enhance the demand forecast within the MPS horizon, and addresses the difficulties with frequent re-scheduling and sharp fluctuations in near-term demand. The prototype combines expert system and decision support system technology in an integrated supply planners' workbench. The workbench functionality, technical specifications and architecture are presented, in addition to a discussion of the forecasting and rulesbase rationale.",

We propose a toolchain for effectively solving these SC-ProbLog programs, which consists of two stages. In the first stage, decision diagrams are compiled for the underlying distributions. These diagrams are converted into models that are solved using Mixed Integer Programming or Constraint Programming solvers in the second stage. We show that, to yield linear constraints, decision diagrams need to be compiled in a specific form. We introduce a new method for compiling small Sentential Decision Diagrams in this form. We evaluate the effectiveness of several variations of this toolchain on test cases in viral marketing and bioinformatics.",

Product line designs are NP-hard, which implies that it requires an unacceptable amount of time to obtain the guaranteed optimal solution to a problem of reasonable scale. Machine learning techniques such as genetic algorithms can provide very good solutions to these problems. In this chapter, we describe the architecture and user interface of a multi-feature decision support system, PRODLINE, which allows the decision maker to address the decision problem of product line designs. A key feature of the system is its ability to provide users with solutions using different solution techniques as well as the ability to change easily the algorithm parameters to assess if improvements in the solution are possible. A final novel and major advantage of the PRODLINE system is that it permits the user to consider strategic competitive responses to the optimal product line design problem.",

One of the challenges of using SVMs in this context is to properly control for preference heterogeneity among individuals to construct robust partworths. In this work, we present a new technique that obtains all individual utility functions simultaneously in a single optimization problem based on three objectives: complexity reduction, model fit, and heterogeneity control. While complexity reduction and model fit are dealt using SVMs, heterogeneity is controlled by shrinking the individual-level partworths toward a population mean. The proposed approach is further extended to kernel-based machines, conferring flexibility to the model by allowing nonlinear utility functions. Experiments on simulated and real-world datasets show that the proposed approach in its linear form outperforms existing methods for choice-based conjoint analysis.",

However, few studies have investigated VR from the perspective of social media, even though social media has changed how people communicate and emerged as an essential marketing channel. An approach of two-layer hierarchical concept decomposition structure was proposed to investigate the temporal trend of VR development from the perspective of the public. Accordingly, Twitter posts related to VR in 2015 and 2016 were crawled and analyzed by our proposed approach. The mining results determined that public focus shifted from VR headsets in 2015 to content in 2016. This suggests that VR devices are perceived as having gradually developed and that the next challenge and business opportunity is VR content and applications. In the era of big data and artificial intelligence, our concept decomposition approach contributes to the content analysis of acquiring insight from massive user-generated content, which extracts temporal trends in a holistic view and individual insights on a detailed scale.",

In order to fully understand how digital media impact on society and the communication landscape, our conceptualisation needs to include new entertainment media, especially computer games. Interactivity here might mean interaction with the AI (artificial-intelligence) or human players. or both, but the crucial difference lies in the fact that the interaction takes place in a 'world' created by the software. Despite the discussion about 'gamification' in marketing and a tradition of game studies in the humanities, there have been few attempts to treat computer games not only as trivial culture, but as a persuasive device, as a way to shape public opinion.

However, the regulatory framework for developing and marketing a new health technology implementing ML may be quite complex. Other issues include the legal liability and the attribution of negligence in case of errors. Some of the above-mentioned concerns could be, at least partially, resolved in case the ML software is classified as a 'medical device', a category covered by EU/national provisions. Concluding, the challenge is to understand how sustainable is the regulatory system in relation to the ML innovation and how legal procedures should be revised in order to adapt them to the current regulatory framework.",

   "content": "Over 70% of patients with acne vulgaris wait at least 1 year before seeing a dermatologist and instead use over-the-counter (OTC) acne treatments. This study determined the association between product characteristics (ingredients, vehicles, and marketing claims) and consumer-reported positive and negative features of top-rated acne OTCs. This cohort study evaluated the top 1% of acne OTCs across the five largest online retailers. Products were analyzed for product characteristics and consumer-reported features. Artificial intelligence data scraper software was utilized to collect reviews, and a natural language processing algorithm was used to tag key phrases within reviews and categorize them based on characteristics and sentiment (positive or negative). An inter-rater reliability test compared reliability of results between a human rater and the software. In this cohort of 149 products, the most frequent ingredients were salicylic acid (33.6%) and benzoyl peroxide (19.5%). Over one-third of top-selling products contained solely natural ingredients. Product ingredients, over product vehicle, price, marketing claims, or packaging, were most associated with consumer-reported product effects. Products with active ingredients were reported more frequently as effective in treating acne (p < 0.001) and with side effects, such as erythema (p = 0.054) and hypersensitivity reactions (p = 0.0016). Products with natural ingredients were associated with improving skin texture (p = 0.008) and application ease (p = 0.04). Product ingredients, over vehicle, price, marketing claims, and packaging were the greatest indicator of a consumer's experience with acne OTCs. Given the wide array of and heavy reliance on OTCs to treat acne, information on product experience inform dermatologists on consumer preferences.",

A poor forecasting approach for the product demands in marketing must cause to decrease competitive capability, lose customers and increase costs. A real case of the product demand forecasting was studied by an artificial neural network (ANN) approach demonstrated in this paper. The studied case is a medium-scale electrical connectors production corporation in Taiwan, which manufactures a variety of the connectors to supply marketing needs of diverse assembly products including mobile telephone, TFT, PDA, CD-ROM, CD-RW, DVD-ROM, DVD-player, notebook computer, digital camera, etc.. The types of the connectors produced by the studied firm are over 50. Owing to the insufficient experimental data provided by the studied corporation, a simulation tool called AweSim was used to simulate the orders of the various types of connectors, according to the historical received orders, and a set of the simulated data was used to train the proposed back-propagation network (BPN) so as to offer a proper demand forecasting tool to the studied firm. Four BPN structures were trained and tested and the best one was determined by ANOVA analysis. The BPN demand forecasting has being used by the studied corporation.",

   "content": "With the rise of the Internet industry and the technique of artificial intelligence, personalized services are increasingly important in recent years for improving user experience and increasing corporates' competitiveness and profits. Precise prediction of customers' behaviors has shown great effects in modern business marketing, especially when making personalized decisions. In this paper, we develop a deep learning network to make personalized predictions of their behaviors among a list of potential choices. The architecture of this model combines each user's features and his historical event lists by sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) structure and make predictions based on his recent event lists. We also modify the long-short-term memory (LSTM) cell forget gate's structure to enhance the attention ability. Such design, called the attetioned LSTM, converges quicker and better while still maintain the similar performance in open dataset IMDB. In addition, in dealing with personalized prediction problems in real-world datasets provided by our cooperative company, our attentioned LSTM achieves a 10% higher precision in average than the standard LSTM model. The advantage is confirmed in evaluation of this generic method on a real dataset of users' behaviors sequences and individuals' attribute profiles from Ant Financial. It also achieves a great result working on the real-world business scene. This model can also achieve a great performance working on the real-world business scene.",

   "content": "Purpose: In the current business environment, more uncertain than ever before, understanding consumer behaviour is an integral part of an organization's strategic planning and execution process. It is the key driver for becoming a market leader. Therefore, it is important that all processes in business are customer centric. Capturing, categorizing, warehousing, mining, analysing and making sense of data is a real-time challenge for all marketers. Organizations embracing digitization are seeing Big Data getting bigger. Investments are being made in IT infrastructure, Internet of Things, machine learning and artificial intelligence in business decision-making. Marketers need to harness big data by engaging in Data Driven Marketing (DDM) to help organizations choose the 'right' customers, to 'keep' and 'grow' them and to sustain 'growth' and 'profitability'. This research examines DDM adoption practices and how companies can aim to enhance shareholder value by bringing about 'customer centricity' through better use of data. Design/Methodology/Approach: An online survey conducted in 2016 received 180 responses from junior, middle and senior executives. Of the total responses 26% were from senior management, 39% from middle management and the remaining 35% from junior management. Industries represented in the survey included Retail, BFSI, Healthcare and Government, Automobile, Telecommunication, Transport & Logistics and IT. Other industries represented were Aviation, Marketing Research & Consulting, Hospitality, Advertising & Media and Human resource. Among the respondents, 34% represented companies with less than $ 30 million in annual revenues, 15% between $ 30-50 million and $ 50-100 million, 32% between $ 100-500 million, and the remaining 19% with $ 500 million and above in annual revenues. In terms of company size, 60% were companies with 1-500 employees, 13% with 500-1000 and 26% with 1000 and above employees. The survey was done in Dubai which represents a blend of several global economies and hence, can be generalised. Findings: Success of DDM depends upon how well an organization embraces the practice. The first and foremost indicator of an organization's commitment is the extent of resources invested for data driven marketing. Respondents were divided into four categories; Laggards, Dabblers, Contenders, and Leaders based on their 'current level of investments' and ` willingness to enhance investments' soon. 'Leaders' are from Retail, Banking & financial services, transportation & logistics and Telecommunication sectors. The major sources of information are point-of-sales data, social media and other published sources. They use data to understand what and why customers are buying, what their consumption patterns are and what makes them satisfied or dissatisfied. 'Dabblers' are players who have realized the importance of data and have just begun to incorporate it in their marketing in a limited way. 'Contenders' are far more regular in using data for measuring and taking marketing decisions. 'Laggards' are at the other extreme when it comes to using data for customer analysis. Practical implications: The results of the study offer interesting implications for managing the growing sea of data. An iterative and incremental approach is the need of the hour, even if it has to start with baby steps, to invest in and reap the fruits of data driven marketing. The intention to use any system is always dependent on two primary belief factors: perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, however attitudes and social factors are equally important. Investments in the right people, infrastructure and processes early on can result in better marketing due diligence and contribute to higher return on marketing investment, necessary to sustain an organization's growth and profitability. Originality/Value: All organizations, irrespective of size and sector, need to engage in data driven marketing for customer centricity. In this era of digitalization, a marketer needs to wisely handle the volume, velocity, variety and veracity of data. Roger's diffusion of innovation theory identifies factors leading to the adoption of innovation by both individuals and organizations. The theory argues that willingness and ability to adopt depends on awareness, interest, evaluation, trial and adoption ( Rogers, 2003). There is a dearth of knowledge with regards to who is and is not adopting DDM, and how best big data can be harnessed for enhancing effectiveness and efficiency of marketing budget. It is, therefore, imperative to build a knowledge base on DDM practices, challenges and opportunities. Better use of data can help companies enhance shareholder value by bringing about 'customer centricity'.",

   "content": "Purpose Currently, online chat is in common use in e-commerce. By adding social interaction to the online context, companies hope to increase customers' purchasing intentions. However, previous studies have not investigated how social presence is embedded in online business-to-business (B2B) chat conversations between buyers and sellers. Moreover, the functions of online chat in B2B sales have not been investigated. Design/methodology/approach The data was collected at a case company over the course of four years, from which the authors analyzed 157 online chat conversations between buyers (n = 157) and sellers (n = 9) with a theory-driven thematic analysis. In addition, data from the company's customer relationship management system was collected to specify buyer types. Findings The results reveal that social presence was embedded in online B2B chat via buyers' interactive, affective and relationship maintenance responses. Social presence differed depending on the type of buyer, with only existing customers having relationship maintenance responses. E-commerce B2B chat functions can be described as multiple and changing depending on the buyer-seller relationship stage. Originality/value Results bring scientific utility to B2B sales and marketing research, as the authors build a bridge between social presence, the existing theoretical model on B2B buyer-seller relationship development and online chat as a communication medium. Other researchers may use this understanding when exploring B2B buyer-seller interaction in different digitalized communication media.",

   "content": "The consumer decision journey model has become increasingly important to understand consumer decisionmaking processes. Although the term originally emerged with Court et al. in 2009, the various current perspectives of the consumer journey suggest the existence of distinct literature and theoretical roots that have yet to be fully explored in detail. The objective of the paper is to semi-systematically review the main theories and models that constitute the foundation on which the consumer journey has evolved. Furthermore, given the lack of academic studies reflecting on the influence of more recent technologies based on artificial intelligence on the consumer journey, this study aims to fill this gap in an attempt to mold further theory development around the consumer journey concept. 74 relevant papers were retrieved mainly from a detailed search on SCOPUS, as well as a backward and forward citation analysis. A thematic analysis resulted in the identification of three literature streams that contribute to the consumer journey literature. This represents a furthering of the theoretical knowledge regarding the consumer journey and its foundations. By also discussing a future perspective, a holistic and comprehensive basis is provided to structure and assist how marketing managers can perceive the consumer decision journey.",

Since March 2009, Graf has had a new role as SAP's first-ever chief sustainability officer, leading a global team that oversees all sustainability-related initiatives, from the creation of solutions that enable sustainable business processes for customers to the organization's own sustainability operations. Graf's first task as an inaugural CSO was one of perception. I had to be very careful not to come across as a marketing show, he says. That means when we talk externally, the initial conversation is all about SAP as a role model. Once SAP established its credibility based on its own initiatives and metrics, using its own systems, it was able to communicate to customers that they too could reach their sustainability goals using SAP's systems. Graf's second, and bigger task, was to grapple with internal corporate strategy. He had to make the business case for sustainability-driven actions and the case for trying to build SAP into a sustainability role model to SAP's own board of directors. His case was built on compliance, resource productivity, market opportunity, energizing the work force and sustaining a business model. In this interview, Graf discusses how he made the sustainability case internally, what the payoffs have been and how SAP customers have and haven't - responded.",

Research shows, however, that sales forecasts of new products are highly inaccurate due to scarcity of historical data and weakness in subjective judgements required to compensate for lack of data. The present study explores sales forecasting performed by human groups and compares the accuracy of group forecasts generated by traditional polling to those made using real-time Artificial Swarm Intelligence (ASI), a technique which has been shown to amplify the forecasting accuracy of human teams in a wide range of fields. In collaboration with a major fashion retailer and a major fashion publisher, three groups of fashion-conscious millennial women (each with 15 participants) were asked to predict the relative sales volumes of eight clothing products (sweaters) during the 2018 holiday season, first by ranking each sweater's sales in an online poll, and then using an online software platform called Swarm to form an ASI system. The Swarm-based forecasts were significantly more accurate than polling such that the top four sweaters ranked using Swarm sold 23.7% more units than the top four sweaters as ranked by survey, (p = 0.0497). These results suggest that ASI swarms of small groups can be used to forecast sales with significantly higher accuracy than a traditional polling.",

   "content": "Organizations are beginning to adopt and capitalize on the functionality of AI in their recruitment processes. However, little is known about how potential candidates regard the use of AI as part of the recruitment process and whether or not it influences their likelihood to apply for a job. Our research finds that attitudes towards organizations that use AI in the recruitment process, significantly influences the likelihood that potential candidates will complete the application process. The novelty factor of using AI in the recruitment process, mediates and further positively influences job application likelihood. These positive relationships between attitudes towards the use of AI in the recruitment process and the likelihood of applying for a job have several important practical implications. First, it means that whilst anxiety is naturally present when AI is part of the recruitment process, the anxiety doesn't really affect the completion of job applications and therefore, organizations do not need to spend money on either hiding their use of AI or reducing the anxiety levels of potential candidates. To the contrary, the research suggests that organizations do not need to hide their use of AI in fear of alienating potential candidates, rather organizations may want to promote their use of AI in the recruitment process and focus on potential candidates that already have positive views of both the organization and AI.",

Using the examples of telematics data in car insurance, efforts by health insurers to incentivize health behaviours (for example through the use of fitness trackers), and insurance companies' own marketing materials, we assess the current state of play in the field of 'personalized' insurance pricing, pointing to obstacles as well as opportunities associated with its development. We then set these contemporary developments against a longer history of insurance pricing, understood as a history of arranging and classifying objects and persons for the purposes of calculating risk. We show that in its longer history, insurance reflected but also contributed to uncertainties about the distinction between persons and property. Drawing these two strands together, we conclude by assessing the implications of insurtech for future understandings of personhood. While there is scope for new categories of personhood to emerge, we show that there are also important continuities between past and present in terms of the challenge of bringing persons, parts of persons, material objects and pecuniary interests into successful alignment.",

Varying results for the same individual renders the technology ineffective and untrustworthy. In this paper, we demonstrate the impact of domain differences in automated text-based personality prediction. We also propose different approaches for domain error correction to meet different needs: (a) single or multi-domain correction and (b) outcome-based or input feature-based error correction. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods. Our findings demonstrate a significant improvement of prediction accuracy with the proposed methods. (e.g., 20-30% relative error reduction using outcome-based error correction or 48% increase of F1 score using feature-based error correction).",

The present study proposed a customer continuance model to predict continuance intention for fintech chatbots and that cognitive and emotional dimensions positively influence the growth in a user's attitude toward fintech chatbots, which in turn, positively influences continuance intention over time. In total, 401 customers of fintech chatbots were surveyed through three time points to examine the relationship between these variables over six months. The results support the theoretical model of this research and can advance the literature of fintech chatbots and the information technology adoption model.",

These methods, however, neglect the effects of social interactions and temporal dynamics relevant for innovation diffusion. Novel approaches rooted in artificial intelligence and social network analysis research enable to model these complex processes in realistic computer models and to simulate potential market developments. In a case study investigating the acceptance of electric vehicles we developed an agent-based model and simulated target group specific scenarios of diffusion. Our results indicate that there is a high potential for electric vehicles in certain segments of the market, which could achieve considerable market share if a suitable choice of products is available. Moreover, the flexible structure of our model allows to explore the impact of various interventions (e.g. marketing strategies) as well as the analysis of potential acceptance of further innovation fields.",

This cumulative evolution of Intelligent Decision Support Systems (IDSSs) has served to stimulate industrial activity and enhanced the lives of most people that the modern world. This publication highlights a series of current contributions to enhance the collective body of knowledge. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computational Intelligence (CI) techniques continue to be successfully employed to generate human-like decision-making, while simultaneously providing greater access to information to solve data intensive problems. This book documents innovative contributions that represent advances in Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems. Newresearch recognises that society is familiar with modern AIP and increasingly expect richer IDT systems. Today there is a growing reliance on automatically processing information into knowledge with less human input. Society has already digitised its past and continues to progressively automate knowledge management for the future and increasingly expect to access this information using mobile devices. This book seeks to inform and enhance the exposure of research on intelligent systems and intelligence technologies that utilize novel and leading-edge techniques to improve decision-making. Each chapter concentrates on the theory, design, development, implementation, testing or evaluation of IDT techniques or applications. These approaches have the potential to support decision making in the areas of management, international business, finance, accounting, marketing, healthcare, production, networks, traffic management, crisis response, human interfaces and, military applications. All fourteen chapters represent a broad spread of topics across the domain and highlight how research is being realised to benefit society. Students, professionals and interested observers within the knowledge-based and intelligent information management domain will benefit from the diversity and richness of the content.",

Since the PLSP model is nonlinear and integer, two of the solution procedures use genetic encoding to relax the NP hard model. The relaxations result in linear integer and shortest path models for the fitness evaluation which are solved using branch and bound and labeling algorithms, respectively. Performance of the quality of solutions generated by the procedures is evaluated for various problem sizes and customer preference structures. The results show that the genetic relaxations provide efficient and effective solution methodologies for the problem, when compared to the pure artificial intelligence technique of genetic search. The impact of the preference structure on the product line and the managerial implications of the Solution characteristics generated by the genetic relaxations are also discussed. The models can be used to explicitly consider tradeoffs between marketing and operations concerns in designing a product line. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

   "content": "The era of big data has, among others, three characteristics: the huge amounts of data created every day and in every form by everyday people, artificial intelligence tools to mine information from those data and effective algorithms that allow this data mining in real or close to real time. On the other hand, opinion mining in social media is nowadays an important parameter of social media marketing. Digital media giants such as Google and Facebook developed and employed their own tools for that purpose. These tools are based on publicly available software libraries and tools such as Word2Vec (or Doc2Vec) and fasttext, which emphasize topic modeling and extract low-level features using deep learning approaches. So far, researchers have focused their efforts on opinion mining and especially on sentiment analysis of tweets. This trend reflects the availability of the Twitter API that simplifies automatic data (tweet) collection and testing of the proposed algorithms in real situations. However, if we are really interested in realistic opinion mining we should consider mining opinions from social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, which are far more popular among everyday people. The basic purpose of this paper is to compare various kinds of low-level features, including those extracted through deep learning, as in fasttext and Doc2Vec, and keywords suggested by the crowd, called crowd lexicon herein, through a crowdsourcing platform. The application target is sentiment analysis of tweets and Facebook comments on commercial products. We also compare several machine learning methods for the creation of sentiment analysis models and conclude that, even in the era of big data, allowing people to annotate (a small portion of) data would allow effective artificial intelligence tools to be developed using the learning by example paradigm.",

This study compares the accuracy of human and computer-based personality judgments, using a sample of 86,220 volunteers who completed a 100-item personality questionnaire. We show that (i) computer predictions based on a generic digital footprint (Facebook Likes) are more accurate (r = 0.56) than those made by the participants' Facebook friends using a personality questionnaire (r = 0.49); (ii) computer models show higher inter-judge agreement; and (iii) computer personality judgments have higher external validity when predicting life outcomes such as substance use, political attitudes, and physical health; for some outcomes, they even outperform the self-rated personality scores. Computers outpacing humans in personality judgment presents significant opportunities and challenges in the areas of psychological assessment, marketing, and privacy.",

The increased need for more sustainable fashion business operations, when coupled with the prospect that business might never be as usual again, calls for innovative e-commerce led practices. Recently, stakeholders have been experimenting with the idea of introducing digital humans for a more active role in fashion through the developments in artificial intelligence, virtual, augmented and mixed reality. As there is a lack of all-important empirical evidence on the consumer's propensity to interact with digital humans, we aim to quantitatively analyse consumer attitudes towards the propensity to interact with digital humans to uncover insights to help fashion businesses seeking to diversify their operations. The results reveal interesting, and statistically significant insights which can be useful for fashion business stakeholders for designing, developing, testing, and marketing digital human-based solutions. Besides, our findings contribute current insights to the existing literature on how consumers interact with digital humans, where research tends to be scarce.",

Software allows service to be physically stored and allows physical objects to perform services. Managing products that have evolved into software products creates difficult challenges for managers as software does not resemble either tangible goods or intangible services in terms of production, operations, cost structure, or prescribed strategy. Every time a business replaces an employee with an e-service interaction, and every time a business adds a line of code to a previously inert object, the nature of that business changes. And as software gets more capable, its nature as a product changes as well by adding unique product characteristics summarized as complexity, intelligence, autonomy, and agency.",

A proper methodology for sentiment analysis is a crucial asset in this regard. However, when monitoring major public events the behaviour or social media users may be strongly biased by punctual actions of the participating characters and the sense of group belonging, which is typically linked to specific geographical areas. In this paper, we present a solution combining a location prediction methodology with an unsupervised technique for sentiment analysis to assess automatically the engagement of social network users in different countries during an event with worldwide impact. As far as the authors know, this is the first time such techniques are jointly considered. We demonstrate that the technique is coherent with the intrinsic disposition of individual users to typical actions of the characters participating in the events, as well as with the sense of group belonging.

Recent advances in this form of artificial intelligence has been suggested to allow content creators and managers to transcend their tasks from creation towards editing, thus overcoming a common problem: the tyranny of the blank screen. In this research, we address this topic by proposing a novel system design that will suggest engagement-driven message features as well as automatically generate critical and fully written unique Tweet message components for the goal of maximizing the probability of relatively high engagement levels. Our multi-methods design relies on the use of econometrics, machine learning, and Bayesian statistics, all of which are widely used in the emerging fields of Business and Marketing Analytics. Our system design is intended to analyze Tweet messages for the purpose of generating the most critical components and structure of Tweets. We propose econometric models to judge the quality of written Tweets by way of engagement-level prediction, as well as a generative probability model for the auto-generation of Tweet messages. Testing of our design demonstrates the need to take into account the contextual, semantic, and syntactic features of messages, while controlling for individual user characteristics, so that generated Tweet components and structure maximizes the potential engagement levels.",

The potential market for CBR appears enormous, particularly in more complex problem-solving domains, but the areas of most immediate interest are in applications where efficient information processing needs are urgent, such as automated help desks. Early experiments pairing CBR with rule-based systems will soon lead to hybrid combinations with other ''close approximation'' technologies, such as neural networks, fuzzy logic systems, genetic algorithms, and so forth. CBR appears headed for a sustaining role not only as a useful complement in knowledge-based information processing technology but also as an engine for ''mainstream '' information tasks of the future (e.g., intelligent text processing and retrieval, data mining, and projective reasoning). This article will discuss this emerging role for CBR and its implications from a marketing perspective.",

While most related studies have mainly focused on resource management, this study targets solving business competition between two operator slices using artificial intelligence. In this competition, each operator slice tries to maximize its own payoff, meanwhile its opponent strives to minimize it. Moreover, two operators update their marketing strategies over time. Therefore, predicting its result is a challenge. After the zero-sum Markov game is modeled for the research problem, we present the min-max Q learning algorithm. In each market state, each slice attains its temporary optimal strategy using the min-max algorithm. In the Markov decision process, Q value is dynamically modified under different market states, and the final Q value presents predictive result for this competition. Finally, a mass of numerical results prove that the min-max Q learning algorithm out-performs the repeated game, in which market state is invariable over time. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

They have come to enhance systems, such as individualised marketing, social media services, and search engines. However, contrasting its growing ubiquity, the architectural industry has been comparatively resistant in its adoption; objectively one of the slowest industries to integrate with machine learning. Machine learning expertise can be separate from professionals in other fields; however, this separation can be a major hinderance in architecture, where interaction between the designer and the design facilitates the production of favourable outcomes. To bridge this knowledge gap, this research suggests that the solution lies with architectural education. Through the development of a novel educative framework, the research aims to teach architecture students how to implement machine learning. Exploration of student-centred pedagogical strategies was used to inform the conceptualisation of the educative module, which was subsequently implemented into an undergraduate computational design studio, and finally evaluated on its ability to effectively teach designers machine learning. The developed educative module represents a step towards greater technological adoption in the architecture industry.",

   "content": "Traditionally, design opportunities and directions are conceived based on expertise, intuition, or time-consuming user studies and marketing research at the fuzzy front end of the design process. Herein, we propose the use of the total technology space map (TSM) as a visual ideation aid for rapidly conceiving high-level design opportunities. The map is comprised of various technology domains positioned according to knowledge proximity, which is measured based on a large quantity of patent data. It provides a systematic picture of the total technology space to enable stimulated ideation beyond the designer's knowledge. Designers can browse the map and navigate various technologies to conceive new design opportunities that relate different technologies across the space. We demonstrate the process of using TSM as a rapid ideation aid and then analyze its applications in two experiments to show its effectiveness and limitations. Furthermore, we have developed a cloud-based system for computer-aided ideation, that is, InnoGPS, to integrate interactive map browsing for conceiving high-level design opportunities with domain-specific patent retrieval for stimulating concrete technical concepts, and to potentially embed machine-learning and artificial intelligence in the map-aided ideation process.",

While considerable research has explored text-based user-generated content on social media, research on photos is still in its early stages. This paper uses a sample of 44,765 Facebook photos from 503 Facebook users in the United States and Germany to determine the degree to which photos play an integral role in people's social media communications. The analysis shows that uploading brand photos (i.e., photos containing a brand name or logo) is related to brand love, brand loyalty, and word-of-mouth (WOM) endorsement of the brand in question. We then code a subsample of these photos for content and train a powerful hybrid machine learning algorithm combining genetic search and artificial neural networks. The resulting algorithm is able to predict users' brand love, brand loyalty, and WOM endorsement from the content of their brand photos posted on Facebook. Finally, we discuss the implications for social media marketing, in particular social media monitoring.",

   "content": "Technologies are becoming increasingly autonomous, able to make decisions and complete tasks on behalf of consumers. Virtual assistants already take care of grocery shopping by replenishing used up ingredients while cooking machines prepare these ingredients and implement recipes. In the future, consumers will be able to delegate substantial parts of the shopping process to autonomous shopping systems. Where as the functional benefits of these systems are evident, they challenge psychological consumption motives and ingrained human-machine relationships due to the delegation of decisions and tasks to technology. The authors take a cross-disciplinary approach drawing from research in marketing, psychology, and human-computer interaction to examine barriers to adoption of autonomous shopping systems. They identify different types of psychological and cultural barriers, and suggest ways to craft the online and bricks-and-mortar retail environment to overcome these barriers along the consumer journey. The article finishes with implications for policy makers and a future research agenda for researchers examining autonomous technologies. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Not only do women pay great attention to facial care, but in recent years, men's consumption in this area has also grown year by year. In facial care, in addition to sunscreen, skin care, tattoos and other chemical-based skin care products, mechanical skin washing machine has also become one of the most popular beauty appliances in recent years. In order to learn the effectiveness of various face care products and tools, in this paper, we have proposed an intelligent system that integrates face washing, wireless cameras, smart phones, and cloud image analysis functionality to allow users to obtain product recommendations. The proposed system is easy to carry and provides seven analysis functionalities, such as skin color, pigmentation, skin texture, wrinkles, pores, texture analysis, and would produce an in-depth analysis report. The proposed system is not only helpful for personal beauty care, but also beneficial for professional medical clinics and makeup companies. The collected big data will also be utilized as a reference for future cosmetics, and potential medical and biotechnology company product development and marketing.",

Game theory is the part of mathematics approach extended by Nash and adopted to psychology, sociology, politics, economics and informatics (artificial intelligence) problems. Game Theory provides mathematical tools for analyzing situations in which parties, called players, make decisions that are interdependent. This causes each player to consider the other player's possible decisions, or strategies, in formulating his own strategy. This approach based on the assumption, that a solution to a game describes the optimal decisions of the players, who may have similar, opposed, or mixed interests, and the outcomes that may result from these decisions. This will be described as an example.",

We provide a new approach based on an ensemble model of three widely used sentiment analysis algorithms: TextBlob, OpinionFinder and Stanford NLP. In this work we investigated the performance of these latter algorithms on large, real datasets. Then, we designed two ensembles (1) one based on multivariate regression that computes a final prediction from three classification algorithms and (2) an ensemble that is based on majority rule. We computed the accuracy of the ensemble framework on labeled real datasets used in the literature that include tweets, as well as Amazon, Yelp and IMDb movie reviews. Our experiments indicated that the ensemble algorithms outperformed all three sentiment algorithms. The ensemble learning algorithm draws from the strengths of the individual sentiment algorithms, avoiding the need to select just one algorithm, creating a stronger tool for harnessing Emotion AI. This approach creates promises beyond the tweets and reviews analyzed here and can potentially be applied to marketing, finance, politics, and beyond.",

   "content": "A simple smile can indicate our approval, happiness or positive thoughts, while a scowl might signal displeasure or anger. Understanding facial expressions and their meanings are crucial not only in our daily life communication, but also in many applications. For example, in marketing, the customers' facial expressions indicate their response towards a product. In artificial intelligence (Al), robots can use human facial expressions as a cue for understanding their emotion in order to respond appropriately. This paper proposes a method for recognizing human facial expressions from images using local Gabor filter, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant. Analysis (LDA). The system starts by applying the face detection algorithm to detect the face from an image. From the face, the system extracts the Gabor filter responses and maps these responses into the novel feature subspace using the joined framework of PCA and LDA. Note that, in our framework, the principle component removal is also integrated into the framework. Based on the weighted neighbor approach, the system finally classifies human expressions into 4 different classes: anger, surprise, happiness and neutral. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the baselines.",

In such cases, it is very useful for them to take into consideration the use of the neuromarketing tools as research methods. This paper presents the results of an eye-tracking experiment which analyses the consumer's reactions towards home service robots and their appearance. A picture collage containing four types of service robots with more or less human-like characteristics was presented to the subjects. The results of the eye-tracking experiment show that the consumers are not yet prepared to accept robots with an increased level of anthropomorphic appearance. The key performance indicators show that the robot with the least human-like characteristics was the first one to be noticed, while the robot with the largest display has been studied for the longest time. Furthermore, most consumers have been curious about the various tasks done by each robot and have watched their descriptions for a relatively long period of time.",

Therefore, detection of fake reviews is needed. Unfortunately, so far, automatic detection has only had partial success in this challenging task. In this research, we address the creation and detection of fake reviews. First, we experiment with two language models, ULMFiT and GPT-2, to generate fake product reviews based on an Amazon e-commerce dataset. Using the better model, GPT-2, we create a dataset for a classification task of fake review detection. We show that a machine classifier can accomplish this goal near-perfectly, whereas human raters exhibit significantly lower accuracy and agreement than the tested algorithms. The model was also effective on detected human generated fake reviews. The results imply that, while fake review detection is challenging for humans, machines can fight machines in the task of detecting fake reviews. Our findings have implications for consumer protection, defense of firms from unfair competition, and responsibility of review platforms.",

Information communication technology has rapidly changed television viewing since the beginning of this century, and the reproducibility of audience ratings as media indicators is beginning to be questioned. This is because television viewing through various devices must be considered, due to the decline of simultaneous viewing at a fixed time. This research applies artificial intelligence to explore several questions. What viewing features span media and devices? What are the viewer attitude models inherent in those features? What are the functions and rules driving the model? Can these be converted into knowledge, and can new hypotheses be obtained from this knowledge? For this, the technologies of natural language processing, neural network, and automated reasoning are applied. From data sequences including property amounts representing viewing attitudes, we visualize time-series feature patterns and extract a state space model driving these features and logical rules between the variables. This research is an example of the real-world application of a technical framework that combines symbolic inference and feature extraction, opening possibilities for more advanced reasoning.",

The authors highlight the importance of traveling companions, who interact with the decision maker through one or more phases of the journey, and they argue that the social distance between the companion(s) and the decision maker is an important factor in how social influence affects that journey. They also consider customer journeys made by decision-making units consisting of multiple individuals and increasingly including artificial intelligence agents that can serve as surrogates for social others. The social customer journey concept integrates prior findings on social influences and customer journeys and highlights opportunities for new research within and across the various stages. Finally, the authors discuss several actionable marketing implications relevant to organizations' engagement in the social customer journey, including managing influencers, shaping social interactions, and deploying technologies.",

   "content": "Purpose With the rise of digital media and content marketing, business-to-business (B2B) technology firms increasingly use narratives in their marketing strategy. If research has studied the impact of narrative on audiences, the structuration of the narrative strategies is still an overlooked area. The purpose of this paper is to understand the structuration of narrative strategies. Design/methodology/approach Authors studied the cases of narratives on the Internet of Things produced by two leading technology firms, IBM and Cisco, between 2012 and 2016. Material includes advertising campaigns, blogs, written customer cases, white papers, public speeches and selling discourses. Findings The research highlights the importance of metanarratives as the core of the structuration of seemingly different contents. It also shows how firms tap into fundamental mythic archetypes and broader sociocultural narratives to try and legitimate the emerging technology. Finally, research also introduces the concept of transmedia strategy and illustrates its use by the two firms studied. Research limitations/implications - The results are based on only two cases of multinational firms, limiting the generalization of the findings. Practical implications - The results of the research may encourage firms to use more narrative branding strategies. They also offer directions for the key elements to manage when elaborating a narrative strategy (defining key metanarratives, identifying and using broader sociocultural narratives, designing a transmedia strategy). Originality/value The paper is among the first to try to understand the structuration of narrative branding strategies. While exploratory, it contributes to research on B2B branding and digital branding by bringing the narrative into B2B branding research.",

However, the deep learning algorithms developed from the neural network are normally regarded as a black box because their network structure and weights are unable to be interpreted by a human user. In general, customers in the banking industry have the rights to know why their applications have been rejected by the decisions made by black box algorithms. In this paper, a practical grafting method was proposed to combine the global and the local models into a hybrid model for explainable AI. Two decision tree-based models were used as the global models because their highly explainable ability could work as a skeleton or blueprint for the hybrid model. Another two models including the deep neural network and the k-nearest neighbor model were employed as the local models to improve accuracy and interpretability respectively. A financial distress prediction system was implemented to evaluate the performance of the hybrid model and the effectiveness of the proposed grafting method. The experiment results suggested the hybrid model based on the terminal node grafting might increase the accuracy and interpretability depending on the chosen local models.",

Emotional extraction is defined in two ways. One iteration involves the transfer of emotional resources from one individual or group to another, such as that which occurs in the work of caring for others, but which also increasingly occurs in the work of producing new technology, such as emotionally aware computers. A second instance of emotional extraction entails the use of emotion knowledge - or theories about emotions, such as emotional intelligence - to generate conclusions or predictions about human behaviour. Emotional extraction in service work, management, marketing, social media, artificial intelligence, and neuroscience are discussed. Mining the mind' focuses in particular on emotional extraction that enhances both productivity and predictability, in turn tracing how emotionally extractive sites are implicated within the production and hierarchical valuation of difference - especially racial and gendered, but also neural difference - in everyday life. The article aims to offer scholars in cultural studies, as well as critical race theory, feminist theory, and critical disability studies, ways to think about this newly intensifying resource extraction and the intersections of culture, capital, and human experience that such extraction indexes and makes possible.",

   "content": "Text annotation is the process of identifying the sense of a textual segment within a given context to a corresponding entity on a concept ontology. As the bag of words paradigm's limitations become increasingly discernible in modern applications, several information retrieval and artificial intelligence tasks are shifting to semantic representations for addressing the inherent natural language polysemy and homonymy challenges. With extensive application in a broad range of scientific fields, such as digital marketing, bioinformatics, chemical engineering, neuroscience, and social sciences, community detection has attracted great scientific interest. Focusing on linguistics, by aiming to identify groups of densely interconnected subgroups of semantic ontologies, community detection application has proven beneficial in terms of disambiguation improvement and ontology enhancement. In this paper we introduce a novel distributed supervised knowledge-based methodology employing community detection algorithms for text annotation with Wikipedia Entities, establishing the unprecedented concept of community Coherence as a metric for local contextual coherence compatibility. Our experimental evaluation revealed that deeper inference of relatedness and local entity community coherence in the Wikipedia graph bears substantial improvements overall via a focus on accuracy amelioration of less common annotations. The proposed methodology is propitious for wider adoption, attaining robust disambiguation performance.",

   "content": "Among the many approaches towards fuel economy, the adoption of electric vehicles (EV) may have the greatest impact. However, existing studies on EV adoption predict very different market evolutions, which causes a lack of solid ground for strategic decision making. New methodological tools, based on Artificial Intelligence, might offer a different perspective. This paper proposes supervised Machine Learning (ML) techniques to identify key elements in EV adoption, comparing different ML methods for the classification of potential EV purchasers. Namely, Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Networks, Deep Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting Models, Distributed Random Forests, and Extremely Randomized Forests are modeled utilizing data gathered on users' inclinations towards EV. Although a Support Vector Machine with polynomial kernel slightly outperforms the other algorithms, all of them exhibit comparable predictability, implying robust findings. Further analysis provides evidence that having only partial information (e.g. only socioeconomic variables) has a significant negative impact on model performance, and that the synergy across several types of variables leads to higher accuracy. Finally, the examination of misclassified observations reveals two well-differentiated groups, unveiling the importance that the profiling of potential purchaser may have for marketing campaigns as well as for public agencies that seek to promote EV adoption.",

For the present work, a novel methodology is proposed for the forecasting of time series in wind energy systems; it consists of a high-order neural network that is trained on-line by the extended Kalman filter algorithm. Unlike most modern artificial intelligence methods of forecasting, which are based on hybridizations, data pre-filtering or deep learning methods, the proposed method is based on the simplicity of implementation, low computational complexity and real-time operation to produce 15-step-ahead forecasting in a time series of wind speed, generated power and energy price. The proposed scheme has been evaluated using real data from open access repositories of wind farms. The results show that an on-line training of the neural network produces high precision, without the need for any other information beyond a few past observations.",

   "content": "One of the major quality of grading fruits is its appearance. Appearance is effects the marketing and choice of consumer. Colour, texture, size, shape are used to find quality of fruit. But the sellers controlling the external quality of fruits to get high profit. In earlier observations, implemented products, computer vision systems for external controlling quality so grading and classification of fruits is based on observations. The proposed system depend on image processing to classify and grade quality of fruits by using mean of image, colour and HOG (Histogram of gradient) feature extractions are used to classify the fruit quality. All machine learning algorithms are used to find the better accuracy of data how it is predicting. In proposed method first data set is collected, then pre-processing is applied for better results. Machine learning algorithms (K-nearest neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and PCA is used for dimension reduction and to get good accuracy to implement the system. For big data pre-processing and to get better results Deep learning (CNN) is used to test the fruit in real time world with result and audio sounds. Audio is used to detect object by hearing also.

These are associated with the current phase of digitization and robotization in anticipation of the further groundbreaking technological revolution. Radical changes await not only labour markets, individual economies, and entire societies. Society 4.0 or even 5.0 are presented. The authors of the paper evoke several fundamental questions raised by the emergence of new technologies at the moral level. Whether it is rational to behave ethically in conditions of digital society 4.0? How new modern technology influences human values, and how does one change himself? What role does responsibility play in introducing modern technologies? Is there Ethics 4.0 or Machine Ethics as part of artificial intelligence? Over the past two decades, ethics has become a fashionable word, just like corporate social responsibility (CSR). Are they just the popular fashion themes for education and business or have a legitimate mission here? Are marketing practices of manipulation and deception compatible with ethics? The contribution draws on available sources and realities within the Czech Republic and the EU and critically evaluates technology i4.0 contradictory impacts on society",

   "content": "Multiple objects (targets) tracking plays an important role in computer vision. It is considered as the first step in many artificial intelligence applications that are developed to analyze people behavior for either security or statistical purposes. The most important challenge faced by algorithms designed for multiple objects tracking is the identity switches that occur between tracked objects due to occlusions and interactions between these same objects. This work falls within the scope of video-based behavioral marketing analysis and aims to better understand the purchasing behavior of customers by analyzing their movements in a densely-populated sales area. We propose to use a re-identification strategy to prevent these identity switches. This re-identification strategy is based on segmenting detected individuals into head, torso, and legs in addition to the classification of their appearances into front and back poses. This re-identification module is integrated within our tracking system to fuse tracklets obtained from a particle filter based tracking framework in a mono-camera tracking system. The combination of these tracking and re-identification modules allows the recovery of global trajectories for tracked individuals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

   "content": "Decision making is one of the central problems in artificial intelligence and specifically in robotics. In most cases this problem comes with uncertainty both in data received by the decision maker/agent and in the actions performed in the environment. One effective method to solve this problem is to model the environment and the agent as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). A POMDP has a wide range of applications such as: Machine Vision, Marketing, Network troubleshooting, Medical diagnosis etc. We consider a new technique, called Recursive Point Filter (RPF) based on Incremental Pruning (IP) POMDP solver to introduce an alternative method to Linear Programming (LP) filter. It identifies vectors with maximum value in each witness region known as dominated vectors, the dominated vectors at each of these points would then be part of the upper surface. RPF takes its origin from computer graphic. In this paper, we tested this new technique against the popular Incremental Pruning (IP) exact solution method in order to measure the relative speed and quality of our new method. We show that a high-quality POMDP policy can be found in lesser time in some cases. Furthermore, RPF has solutions for several POMDP problems that LP could not converge to in 24 hours.",

Specifically, this empirical research examines the roles of perceived aesthetics, technology readiness, mobile usefulness, and mobile ease of use on behavioral intention. Differing from past mobile payment studies, a newly proposed methodology that involves a dual-stage analysis and an emerging Artificial Intelligence analysis named deep learning was performed on 307 usable responses. Findings revealed that all relationships were supported except for the linkage between mobile ease of use and behavioral intention. The results of this study provide valuable insights to payment companies and smart wearable device manufacturers to come up with plans and marketing strategies to convince the potential adopters to adopt wearable payment, guiding marketers to design a more successful wearable payment solution. Theoretically, the newly integrated theoretical model that incorporates Mobile Technology Acceptance Model, Fashion Theory, and Technology Readiness Theory could help ascertain the relative significance of certain determinants, providing a clearer insight on the acceptance of wearable payment among consumers.

   "content": "By the early 2020s, emotional artificial intelligence (emotional AI) will become increasingly present in everyday objects and practices such as assistants, cars, games, mobile phones, wearables, toys, marketing, insurance, policing, education and border controls. There is also keen interest in using these technologies to regulate and optimize the emotional experiences of spaces, such as workplaces, hospitals, prisons, classrooms, travel infrastructures, restaurants, retail and chain stores. Developers frequently claim that their applications do not identify people. Taking the claim at face value, this paper asks, what are the privacy implications of emotional AI practices that do not identify individuals? To investigate privacy perspectives on soft non-identifying emotional AI, the paper draws upon the following: over 100 interviews with the emotion detection industry, legal community, policy-makers, regulators and NGOs interested in privacy; a workshop with stakeholders to design ethical codes for using data about emotions; a UK survey of 2068 citizens on feelings about emotion capture technologies. It finds a weak consensus among social stakeholders on the need for privacy, this driven by different interests and motivations. Given this weak consensus, it concludes that there exists a limited window of opportunity to societally agree principles of practice regarding privacy and the use of data about emotions.",

An accurate prognosis and the identification of the parameters inflating the possibility of return to work after neurorehabilitation are crucial. Many factors may influence it, such as mobility and, in particular, walking ability. In this pilot study, two emerging technologies have been combined with the aim of developing a prognostic tool for identifying patients able to return to work: a wearable inertial measurement unit for gait analysis and an artificial neural network (ANN). Compared with more conventional statistics, the ANN showed a higher accuracy in identifying patients with respect to healthy subjects (90.9 vs. 75.8%) and also in identifying the subjects unable to return to work (93.9 vs. 81.8%). In this last analysis, the duration of double support phase resulted the most important input of the ANN. The potentiality of the ANN, developed also in other fields such as marketing on social networks, could allow a powerful support for clinicians that today should manage a large amount of instrumentally recorded parameters in patients with stroke.",

While AI climate refers to the shared perceptions of policies, procedures, and practices to support AI initiatives, cognitive service analytics capability refers to the analytical insights driven by AI climate and augmented by both machines and humans to make marketing decisions. However, there is limited knowledge on the antecedents of such analytics capabilities and their overall effects on service innovation and market performance. Drawing on service analytics literature and the microfoundations of dynamic capability theory, this study fills this research gap using in-depth interviews (n = 30) and a survey (n = 276) of service analytics managers within the AI climate in Australia. The findings confirm the five microfoundations of cognitive service analytics capabilities (cognitive technology, cognitive information, cognitive problem solving, cognitive knowledge & skills, cognitive training & development). The findings also highlight the significant mediating effect of service innovation in the relationship between analytics climate and market performance and cognitive service analytics capability and market performance.",

It provides a conceptual overview of the free energy principle; including Markov blankets, active inference, and-in particular-a discussion of selfhood and theory of mind, followed by a brief explanation of how these concepts can explain both neural and cultural models of emotional inference. The underlying hypothesis is that emotion recognition and inference devices will evolve from state-of-the-art deep learning models into active inference schemes that go beyond marketing applications and become adjunct to psychiatric practice. Specifically, this paper proposes that a second wave of emotion recognition devices will be equipped with an emotional lexicon (or the ability to epistemically search for one), allowing the device to resolve uncertainty about emotional states by actively eliciting responses from the user and learning from these responses. Following this, a third wave of emotional devices will converge upon the user's generative model, resulting in the machine and human engaging in a reciprocal, prosocial emotional interaction, i.e., sharing a generative model of emotional states.",

The performed operation has shown an improvement in the performance of the classification algorithm in terms of accuracy. The experimental results were run on a real bank dataset and the J48 decision tree achieved 94.39% accuracy prediction, with 0.975 sensitivity and 0.709 specificity, showing better results when compared to other approaches reported in the existing literature, such as logistic regression (91.79 accuracy; 0.975 sensitivity; 0.495 specificity) and Naive Bayes classifier (90.82% accuracy; 0.961 sensitivity; 0.507 specificity).

   "content": "The Digital Age has only just begun to change how we work. As the digital transformation redefines business, digitization (Digitization) represents a special challenge for businesses in general and for small and medium sized companies (SMEs) in particular. This paper will provide for an insight into and the premise for an upcoming study regarding the awareness, readiness and the capability of German SME to meet this challenge by taking into account their operational processes. It will also introduce the reader to the issues German SMEs deal with when preparing to join the wave of Digitization, Big Data Analytics (BDA), Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The research presented in this paper was undertaken in order to answer the question whether German SMEs are ready for the upcoming challenges and the competition in the worldwide market. A first sign of the heavy interest for Digitization from the SME market was revealed during a short telephone interview which initiated the idea for a survey. The survey showed that nearly all queried SMEs are interested in the subject of Digitization, BDA, ML and/or AI and are willing to implement these innovative facilitators in their (daily) business models through e.g. bots and/or voice-operated machines. Nevertheless, even if there is the will in the market for the implementation of these innovations, it seems as if it - for a high proportion of German SMEs - will not be possible, due to insufficient funds, lack of work force and/or work culture to fully reap the benefits or even lay the fundament of these innovations. The survey also brought to light that, in terms of a company's readiness, there is a huge disparity on a cross-departmental level in one and the same SME; while the marketing department might e.g. be ready and set-up with all necessary systems and datasets, the production department is not at all or vice versa. Therefore, it can be anticipated that even if all market participants want to join the 'lively debate' and be part of it, the actual readiness for subjects such as Digitization, BDA, ML and KI in German SMEs is still on ground zero and will involuntarily be on the agenda for the majority of these enterprises for the next ten to fifteen years.",

AI technology is prominently used for talent acquisition in organizations. This research investigates the adoption of AI technology for talent acquisition. Design/methodology/approach This study employs Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) and Task-Technology-Fit (TTF) framework and proposes a model to explore the adoption of AI technology for talent acquisition. The survey was conducted among the 562 human resource managers and talent acquisition managers with a structured questionnaire. The analysis of data was completed using PLS-SEM. Findings This research reveals that cost-effectiveness, relative advantage, top management support, HR readiness, competitive pressure and support from AI vendors positively affect AI technology adoption for talent acquisition. Security and privacy issues negatively influence the adoption of AI technology. It is found that task and technology characteristics influence the task technology fit of AI technology for talent acquisition. Adoption and task technology fit of AI technology influence the actual usage of AI technology for talent acquisition. It is revealed that stickiness to traditional talent acquisition methods negatively moderates the association between adoption and actual usage of AI technology for talent acquisition. The proposed model was empirically validated and revealed the predictors of adoption and actual usage of AI technology for talent acquisition. Practical implications This paper provides the predictors of the adoption of AI technology for talent acquisition, which is emerging extensively in the human resource domain. It provides vital insights to the human resource managers to benchmark AI technology required for talent acquisition. Marketers can develop their marketing plan considering the factors of adoption. It would help designers to understand the factors of adoption and design the AI technology algorithms and applications for talent acquisition. It contributes to advance the literature of technology adoption by interweaving it with the human resource domain literature on talent acquisition. Originality/value This research uniquely validates the model for the adoption of AI technology for talent acquisition using the TOE and TTF framework. It reveals the factors influencing the adoption and actual usage of AI technology for talent acquisition.",

   "content": "Customer churn is often a rare event in service industries, but of great interest and great value. Until recently, however, class imbalance has not received much attention in the context of data mining [Weiss, G. M. (2004). Mining with rarity: A unifying framework. SIGKDD Explorations, 6 (1), 7-19]. In this study, we investigate how we can better handle class imbalance in churn prediction. Using more appropriate evaluation metrics (AUC, lift), we investigated the increase in performance of sampling (both random and advanced under-sampling) and two specific modelling techniques (gradient boosting and weighted random forests) compared to some standard modelling techniques. AUC and lift prove to be good evaluation metrics. AUC does not depend on a threshold, and is therefore a better overall evaluation metric compared to accuracy. Lift is very much related to accuracy, but has the advantage of being well used in marketing practice [Ling, C., & Li, C. (1998). Data mining for direct marketing problems and solutions. In Proceedings of the fourth international conference on knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD-98). New York, NY: AAAI Press]. Results show that under-sampling can lead to improved prediction accuracy, especially when evaluated with AUC. Unlike Ling and Li [Ling, C., & Li, C. (1998). Data mining for direct marketing problems and solutions. In Proceedings of the fourth international conference on knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD-98). New York, NY: AAAI Press], we find that there is no need to under-sample so that there are as many churners in your training set as non churners. Results show no increase in predictive performance when using the advanced sampling technique CUBE in this study. This is in line with findings of Japkowicz [Japkowicz, N. (2000). The class imbalance problem: significance and strategies. In Proceedings of the 2000 international conference on artificial intelligence (IC-AI'2000): Special track on inductive learning, Las Vegas, Nevada], who noted that using sophisticated sampling techniques did not give any clear advantage. Weighted random forests, as a cost-sensitive learner, performs significantly better compared to random forests, and is therefore advised. It should, however always be compared to logistic regression. Boosting is a very robust classifier, but never outperforms any other technique. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

   "content": "Big data generated from social media and smart mobile devices has been regarded as a key to obtain insights into human behavior and been extensively utilized for launching marketing activities. A successful marketing activity requires attracting high social popularity to their contents, since higher popularity usually indicates stronger influence, more fame and higher revenue. In this paper, we focus on the question of how to improve popularity of videos sharing on websites like YouTube in mobile computing environment. Obviously, composing high quality titles and tags is beneficial for viewers to discover videos of their interests and increase their tendency to watch more videos. However, it is not an easy task for uploaders, which is especially true since the screen is tight for most mobile devices. To this end, this paper proposes a novel hybrid method based on multi-modal content analysis that recommends keywords for video uploaders to compose titles and tags of their videos and then to gain higher popularity. The method generates candidate keywords by integrating techniques of textual semantic analysis of original tags and recognition of video content. On one hand, taking the original keywords of a video as input, the method obtains most relevant words from WordNet and related video titles gathered from the three top video sharing sites (YouTube, Yahoo Video, Bing Video). On the other hand, through recognizing video content with deep learning technology, the method extracts the entity name of video content as candidate keywords. Finally, a TF-SIM algorithm is proposed to rank the candidate keywords and the most relevant keywords are recommended to uploaders for optimizing the titles and tags of their videos. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the social popularity of the videos as well as extend the length of video viewing time per playback.",

   "content": "Recency Frequency Monetary Value (RFM) is a clear and descriptive way to classify a customer database based on purchasing behavior that direct marketers have used with success since almost the last twenty years. Despite the fashion that exists lately around predictive models and artificial intelligence, direct marketing's RFM, still has a place in modern database marketing. In a real business environment, RFM can still be useful when models are not practical because it is user friendly and the outcome is always interpretable. It can also be used to combine with other models. In this paper, we show a real example about how easy, accurate and explainable can be a customer segmentation based on the traditional RFM model and the 2-tuple RFM model applied to a customer database. It will help us to better understand the benefits of applying the 2-tuple model instead of the traditional one. We will be able to see how, by applying a k-means clustering on top of the 2-tuple model, segments have a great applicability from the business point of view. By using descriptive variables, we will clarify the cluster description and the model will provide us an extremely clear idea about how customers behave. The main goal for developing this example was to define the best target for a direct campaign communication. Data used for this analysis belongs to a worldwide home furniture, Scandinavian Retailer, and are related to its loyalty program which give us the members' historical purchase information.

   "content": "This position paper acknowledges that customer orientation is a key requirement for companies to be competitive in the marketplace. Customer orientation has led to concepts, such as personalization, one-to-one-marketing, mass customization and co-creation, which all strive for a strong alignment of individual customer demands and encounters with a company's offerings. Despite the customer is increasingly regarded as an active partner, the overall perspective of customer orientation is still mainly provider-oriented. Adopting the perspective of customers, as argued in this position paper, would help recognizing that customer problems are often broader and more complex than the solutions of single providers. While intermediaries and, more recently, assistants based on artificial intelligence, have emerged to address this demand, their approaches are typically little transparent and follow a black-box paradigm. Using examples from multiple application domains, this position paper proposes elements that need to be addressed to overcome these shortcomings. The concept of customer-induced service orchestration and management shall empower customers to combine services from multiple service providers in order to address their problems in a transparent and white-box way.

   "content": "Development of Big data, artificial intelligence and 5G networks, and advances have changed the marketing environment with the arrival of a hyper-connected society where everything is connected. And Kotler has described this change by naming it Market 4.0. In this environment, connectivity and communication between businesses and consumers have been emphasized, and constant communication is emphasized to match a brand identity and brand image in order to build a strong brand of business. Thus, from the point of view of communication, the brand identity prism model by Kapferer, which is an analytical framework of brand identity and brand image, has been framed. This paper used semantic network analysis to measure brand identity and brand image and analyzed difference in order to study semantic network analysis as strategic tool for building strong brand of enterprise. The brand identity was extracted from the web page managed by Samsung Electronics while the brand image was extracted through SNS and Samsung Members Page. The extracted data were interpreted by means of centrality after data preprocessing. This study found that Samsung Electronics' brand identity and brand image matched that of A global innovative technology company And efficiency was demonstrated by comparing with prior studies studied around case analysis.",

   "content": "In order to perform a Lean and Agile manufacturing plant, functions of a logistics system must be advanced to rapidly respond to the marketing requirements. Based on this viewpoint, this paper presents an intelligent automatic part number generation system developed on a client-server information structure. Up to now, almost all of the commercialized parts numbering systems still need first to manually identify a part number, and then to type the number into a computer; moreover, they are not built with a modern electronic commerce (EC) design tools, e.g., ASP.NET. This manual work may cause a serious problem of the inaccurate data processing. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes an experimental intelligent part numbering system in the form of a knowledge-based structure. The structure was constructed with an object-oriented BOM (Bill of Materials) database in which the features of components (parts) can be visually judged and automatically numbered by a set of part number production rules stored in the knowledge base. If numbers of parts and their assembled product(s) can be encoded automatically and accurately, it not only greatly saves the workmanship, but also properly handles the part inventory management, purchasing policy and cost control in a logistics information system.",

   "content": "Consumers' increasing use of voice-activated artificial intelligence technologies is stimulating the development of a new line of research in the field of marketing aiming to analyse the branding implications in this innovative experiential context. The spread of so-called name-brand voice assistants (NBVAs) is creating interesting opportunities in terms of brand anthropomorphism. The brand anthropomorphisation strategies adopted by companies are poorly studied in the academic literature, and only one contribution has been made in the experiential field of NBVAs. Therefore, the objective of our work is to begin to fill this gap by investigating the pillars of brand anthropomorphisation strategies (i.e., activities and branding outcomes) in the specific NBVA context by adopting a managerial perspective. Therefore, we followed an exploratory qualitative approach based on in-depth personal interviews with practitioners engaged in these strategies in the automotive sector. The resulting cognitive map reveals the following three levels of strategic pillars: drivers (i.e., designing a human-like brand voice and human-like consumer-brand dialogue), intermediate outcomes (i.e., brand personality and the strength of consumer-brand relationships), and final outcomes (i.e., multidimensional brand loyalty). Our study enriches both the literature concerning brand anthropomorphisation strategies and the nascent stream on NBVAs and provides managerial guidelines in the new in-car NBVA context.",

   "content": "To fight obesity and educate consumers on how the human body functions, health education and marketing materials often highlight the importance of adopting a cognitive approach to food. One strategy employed to promote this approach is to portray humans as machines. Five studies (and three replication and follow-up studies) using different human-as-machine stimuli (internal body composition, face, appearance, and physical movement) revealed divergent effects of human-as-machine representations. While these stimuli promoted healthier choices among consumers who were high in eating self-efficacy, they backfired among consumers who were low in eating self-efficacy (measured in Studies 1 and 3-5; manipulated in Study 2). This reversal happened because portraying humans as machines activated consumers' expectation of adopting a cognitive, machine-like approach to food (Studies 3 and 4)-an expectation that was too difficult to meet for those with low (vs. high) eating self-efficacy. We tested a solution to accompany human-as-machine stimuli in the field (Study 5): we externally enhanced how easy and doable it was for consumers low in eating self-efficacy to adopt a cognitive approach to food, which effectively attenuated the backfire effect on their lunch choices at a cafeteria.",

Design/methodology/approach - The system makes use of data collected from the franchising business and external environment analysis for decision making in center positioning problems. The fuzzy logic approach is integrated into the system for analyzing the geographical market dynamics including profitability and competitiveness in the district concerned. To demonstrate the application of the proposed FDSS, a case study is conducted in a Hong Kong-based franchising private education center, i.e. Dr I-Kids Education Center. Findings - The tailor made FDSS helps to facilitate the business operations of the franchising education center and develops a district positioning model for the centers located in the 18 districts of Hong Kong. The findings provide a solid foundation for marketing strategy and expansion direction formulation. Originality/value - Due to the globalization of business, managing a growing franchising business model becomes challenging to the franchisor. In order to fully leverage the merits of the franchising system, an intelligent decision support model, focusing on making strategic development plans, is needed so as to expand the scale of business efficiently.",

   "content": "The proliferation of edge computing technologies has boosted the development of new applications for a plethora of edge devices. However, many applications face privacy issues and bandwidth limitations. To solve these limitations, we propose a collaborative learning framework on the edges, named CLONE, which is steered by the real-world data sets collected from a large electric vehicle (EV) company and a grocery store of a shopping mall, respectively. We categorize two application scenarios for CLONE, i.e., CLONE in the training stage (CLONE_training) and CLONE in the inference stage (CLONE_inference). As to CLONE_training, we choose the failure prediction of EV battery and associated components as the first use case. While as for CLONE_inference, customer tracking in a grocery store is selected as another case study. In this work, the goal of the CLONE is to support real-time training and inference for connected vehicles and marketing intelligence services. Our experimental results on the EV data show that CLONE is able to reduce model training time without sacrificing algorithm performance. Furthermore, the experimental results on the video data from the grocery store reveal that CLONE is a useful approach to solve the multitarget multicamera tracking problem in a collaborative fashion.",

Poverty, malnutrition, hunger, climate change, and social inequalities are just some of the trends which the agri-food sector has to cope with. The digital transformation that companies will need to embrace to survive requires new ways of creating, thinking, and working with technology-driven tools to provide value for their businesses and customers. Digitization, whether it pertains to new technologies, the analysis of big data or the development of on-line and spatial applications, can contribute to achieving systemic food production transformation in a way that aligns the sector more closely with contemporary sustainability and health challenges. Digital techniques are leading established companies to renew and innovate their business models by connecting producers to consumers, setting up innovative marketing channels, and improving logistics. Artificial intelligence for smart farming, precision and urban farming, data management for waste-less, blockchain for supply chain traceability and auditability are just some of the disruptive technologies which have been adopting by both start-ups and an increasing number of established companies, redefining their business models. This chapter aims to analyse how these new paradigms are impacting the food sector by providing examples from the real world.",

A significant part of the access-to-justice toolkit must include self-help materials. That much is not new; indeed, the legal aid community has been actively developing pro se guides and forms for decades. But the community has hamstrung its creations in two major ways: first, by focusing these materials almost exclusively on educating LMI individuals about formal law, and second, by considering the task complete once the materials have been made available to self-represented individuals. In particular, modern self-help materials fail to address many psychological and cognitive barriers that prevent LMI individuals from successfully deploying the substance of the materials. In this Article we make two contributions. First, we develop a theory of the obstacles LMI individuals face when attempting to deploy professional legal knowledge. Second, we apply learning from fields as varied as psychology, public health, education, artificial intelligence, and marketing to develop a framework for how courts, legal aid organizations, law school clinics, and others might reconceptualize the design and delivery of civil legal materials for unrepresented individuals. We illustrate our framework with examples of reimagined civil legal materials.",

In the modern world of artificial intelligence, sentiment analysis is one of the essential tools to extract emotion information from massive data. Sentiment analysis is applied to a variety of user data from customer reviews to social network posts. To the best of our knowledge, there is less work on sentiment analysis based on the categorization of users by demographics. Demographics play an important role in deciding the marketing strategies for different products. In this study, we explore the impact of age and gender in sentiment analysis, as this can help e-commerce retailers to market their products based on specific demographics. The dataset is created by collecting reviews on books from Facebook users by asking them to answer a questionnaire containing questions about their preferences in books, along with their age groups and gender information. Next, the paper analyzes the segmented data for sentiments based on each age group and gender. Finally, sentiment analysis is done using different Machine Learning (ML) approaches including maximum entropy, support vector machine, convolutional neural network, and long short term memory to study the impact of age and gender on user reviews. Experiments have been conducted to identify new insights into the effect of age and gender for sentiment analysis.",

Particularly, the World Wide Web evolved from a pure information repository, to a platform for interactive and multimedia applications, leading to new marketing channels. The execution of business processes is more and more shifting to the internet, causing the emergence of new markets and new technologies. Especially small and medium-sized enterprises are confronted with the task Of using the new information and cornmunication technologies, particularly the technology of e-commerce, to gain competitive advantages. This challenge can be mastered by using commercial products providing a connection to Internet marketplaces like eBay. Thus, eBay becomes integrated into IT-systems as an additional sales channel. This is especially useful for selling seasonal products or remaining stock. One vendor Of Such products is AGETO GmbH, located in Jena, Germany. In a joint project of AGETO and the University of Applied Sciences Zwickau a combination and integration of Knowledge Management, Business Intelligence and Artificial Intelligence methods are used for implementing a Decision Support System, aiming at determining the optimum selling time for auctions on public marketplaces. The necessary decision knowledge is derived from a data warehouse comprising of sales data on the electronic marketplace.

Guided by anthropomorphism theory, this study explores how different levels of robot humanness and social interaction opportunities affect consumers' liking for service robots. A review of the extant literature is conducted, yielding three hypotheses that are tested via 953 responses to an online scenario-based experiment. Findings indicate that while consumers prefer higher levels of humanness and moderate-to-high levels of social interaction opportunity, only some participants liked robots more when dialogue (high-interaction opportunity) was offered. Resulting from this study is the proposed Humanized-AI Social Interactivity Framework. The framework extends previous studies in marketing and consumer behavior literature by offering an increased understanding of how households will choose to interact with service robots in domestic environments based on humanness and social interaction. Guidelines for practitioners and two overarching themes for future research emerge from this study. This paper contributes to an increased understanding of potential interactions with service robots in domestic environments.",

This innovation is settled in the design of a mobile application which includes the management of digital tools such as bid data, augmented reality, virtual reality, and global positioning systems. Methodology. The project utilizes a mixed methodology, using quantitative data and qualitative information. A group of marketing tools have been selected involving the design of marketing objectives, the design of a marketing strategy, the planning of actions, the macro and micro analysis of the gastronomic context, and the typing and classification of restaurants and consumers. It also applied tools to analyze the value of digital scenarios such as social media and its content related to cultural expressions, such as culinary tourism, including hashtags, or other digital indexing techniques. Originality: The project aims to build a new user experience through gamification techniques that would let users find restaurants linked to the culture surrounding its territory. It is designed to perform a narrative supported by digital icons, interactive signs, and cybertexts. These are meant to involve consumers and restaurants in order to make them active participants of the mobile application. The experience includes cultural and historical elements through GPS information which will be used for activities like observation races, treasure maps, among other dynamics. This adds value to the experience of visiting new restaurants, since it creates new experiences from the specific territory where the restaurant is located, and adds more possibilities of cultural consumption, like visiting theaters, music halls, museums, galleries, monuments, and architectural heritage. Findings: Tourists play a main role in the gastronomic market, also look for cultural expressions, such as music, theater, cinema, literature, visual arts, among other forms of art. Colombia has increased its tourism by 10% since 2017 (CITUR, 2019), and Bogota has received each year one more million of tourists, starting with 2.660.000 in 2011, and reaching 7.000.000 foreign visitors in 2018. Bogota receives 91% of American tourists that visit Colombia, representing 27% of all tourists in Bogota. This represents 17% of all tourists that visited Colombia in 2017 (IDT, 2014). Foreign visitors are more likely to expend USD$1500 per person, including the use of cellphone services (IDT, 2014). In 2017, 318,000 American tourists visited Bogota and expend USD$477.000.000.00. Practical implications: In Colombia there is no other app nor technological project aiming the development of gastronomic tourism and the cultural market at the same time, through a gamification experience that uses various developments, including, real time Global Positioning System (GPS), Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).",

   "content": "Historically, the fields of Decision Support Systems and Expert Systems grew up from different backgrounds; Management Information Systems and Artificial Intelligence, respectively. As a result, many people still regard them as unrelated fields, although Operational Researchers are working in both of them. Expert Systems in particular have found it difficult to escape from an image of being isolated; not just from Decision Support Systems, but from all other types of computer system. Successful applications appeared to be confined to very well-defined tasks; either small systems for tasks of an operational nature, or large systems requiring expensive specialised computer support. The spread of Expert Systems into management and administrative applications from the scientific/technical domains of the early systems has been very slow. The view put forward in this paper is that for Expert Systems to be applied to problems in management or administration, the traditional 'closed-world' picture of an Expert System is usually inadequate. The real manifestation of the Expert System's role (and indeed that of the human expert) involves much more negotiation and interaction than in scientific/ technical domains. The consequences for the resulting system are that it looks much more like the traditional picture of a Decision Support System than a classic standalone Expert System. The argument will be illustrated by reference to examples of 'Expert System' developments, including systems for production control, crime pattern analysis, telephone marketing, and the drawing up of contracts.",

Drawing on relational cohesion theory, it proposes that cohesion between users and SVAs influences brand engagement behaviors, that is, continuing purchasing other products of the brand, providing knowledge to the brand and referring the brand. Design/methodology/approach Data from a survey of 717 US regular SVA users confirm the validity of the measurement scales and provide the input for the covariance-based structural equation modeling. Findings The results demonstrate that frequent user-SVA interactions evoke positive emotions, which encourage cohesive relationships. Pleasured-satisfaction and interest emerge as strong emotions. Moreover, relational cohesion between users and SVAs promotes engagement with the brand of the assistant. Originality/value This paper applies an interpersonal approach in a context that, to date, has been examined from a predominantly technological perspective. It shows that users develop positive emotions toward smart technologies through their interactions, and establishes the importance of building affective relationships. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to analyze cohesion between users and smart technologies and to examine the effect of this cohesion on user engagement with the brand.",

   "content": "The article is aimed at reviewing and comparing the key aspects of information policy, and describing it as a communication concept. The author extrapolates Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy's model on the object field of information policy. The topicality of the research is determined by the necessity to study the emergence of a new informational society, mediatization of politics, the development of information policy and its institutionalization, information management techniques in the context of artificial intelligence development, as well as by the interdisciplinary character of the phenomenon. The author defines the terms information, social information and information policy, compares and analyses various approaches to interpreting them, shows differences in understanding purposes, functions and components of information policy, and gives the examples of a lateral and a unilateral approaches to defining information policy. The author also determines three concepts of information policy, namely, press relations service, marketing concept, and Rosenstock-Huessy's dialogic concept. In this context, the author specifies four correction discourses relevant in information policy practices (Unity, Faith, Power, and Respect), and infers that Rosenstock-Huessy's concept provides for forming strategic framework for implementing information policy, and journalism in this context is interpreted as a discourse technique of social construction. The key inference suggests that an information policy is aimed at constructing and structuring information landscape, production of meaning and images, and correcting the mass consciousness. Communication campaigns are vied as actions within an information policy.",

   "content": "We propose an effective CAPTCHA with amodal completion and aftereffects and improve it by applying complementary colors and difference of luminance. CAPTCHA is a method which distinguishes human beings from artificial intelligence which is usually called bots on Internet. Bots acquire accounts of web services for unfair uses such as stealth marketing or SPAM attacks. That is, CAPTCHA is a countermeasure against those attacks. The most popular kind of CAPTCHA methods is text-based CAPTCHA in which distorted alphabets and numbers appear with obstacles or noise. However, it is known that all of text-based CAPTCHA algorithms can be analyzed by computers. In addition, too much distortion or noise prevents human beings from alphabets or numbers. There are other kinds of CAPTCHA methods such as image CAPTCHA and audio CAPTCHA. However, they also have problems in use. As a related work, an effective text-based CAPTCHA algorithm with amodal completion was proposed. The CAPTCHA provides computers a large amount of calculation cost while amodal completion helps human beings to recognize characters momentarily. On the other hand, extreme concentration is required for momentary recognition. The CAPTCHA is once improved in our laboratory. Aftereffects are additionally combined with the CAPTCHA algorithm. Moreover, in this paper, we add colors to the algorithm with considering combinations of complementary colors and those of luminance. The aftereffects extend time for recognition of characters from a moment to several seconds.",

However, one of the major challenges is practitioners' hesitation and unwillingness to employ these new technologies in medical practice. This study focuses on identifying the influential factors of adoption intention of smart healthcare services for both clinicians and non-clinicians from the perspective of technology transfer. Through collecting 484 questionnaire data from doctors in Anhui, China, we find support to show that perceived usefulness (PU), attitude, and the experience of using mHealth are key factors that influence both clinicians and non-clinician's adoption intention. Meanwhile, it is confirmed that subjective norm has a positive effect on only clinicians' behavioural intention (BI) while perceived risk (PR) has a negative impact on only non-clinicians' attitude. Among all the constructs, the experience of using mHealth has the strongest positive effect on doctors' adoption intention on smart healthcare services, a positive impact on the PU and perceived ease of use, and a negative impact on the PR. This study provides an improved understanding of doctors' BI of smart healthcare services, and practice guidance for product development and marketing strategies.",

This work extends previously developed methods for the single product design problem.

We investigate the potential advantages of pursuing the avenue of developing hybrid models and then implement and study such hybrid models using two very distinct approaches: namely, seeding the initial GA population with the BS solution, and employing the BS solution as part of the GA operator's process. We go on to examine the impact of two alternate string representation formats on the quality of the solutions obtained by the above proposed techniques. We also explicitly investigate a critical managerial factor of attribute importance in terms of its impact on the solutions obtained by the alternate modeling procedures. The alternate techniques are then evaluated, using statistical analysis of variance, on a fairy large number of data sets, as to the quality of the solutions obtained with respect to the state-of-the-art benchmark and in terms of their ability to provide multiple, unique product line options.",

This paper will discuss the nature of AI-ESTATE in several terms. The problem that AI-ESTATE solves can be seen as a typical type of problem in science and engineering that has a tradition of stimulating the advancement of mechanical/electrical calculation. This tradition starts with the nature and the economics of the calculation problems tackled by Pascal, Leibniz, Turing, Mauchly and Eckert, von Neumann and many others. In the case of AI-ESTATE the advancement is partially stimulated by the economics of system test and diagnosis, the impact of the decoupling of diagnostic decision making from the rest of the Test Environment, and the impact of the people that worked together to provide the IEEE 1232 Standard. The advantages of declarative languages is discussed over the disadvantages of imperative languages in a general context. The form of the logic calculator is discussed and how the gap between data syntax and model semantics is bridged and the calculator is programmed via a declarative or descriptive model editor. A final discussion will focus on how AI-ESTATE might be embedded on a board or cast as an Integrated Circuit (IC).",

   "content": "Data mining is the process of determining new, unanticipated, valuable patterns from existing databases by considering historical and recent developments in statistics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. It can help companies focus on the most important information in their data warehouses. Association rule mining is one of the most highly researched and popular data mining techniques for finding associations between items in a set. It is frequently used in marketing, advertising, and inventory control. Typically, association rules only consider items in transactions (positive association rules). They do not consider items that do not occur together, which can be used to create rules that are also useful for market basket analysis. Also, existing algorithms often generate too many candidate itemsets when mining the data and scan the database multiple times. To resolve these issues in association rule mining algorithms, we propose SARIC (set particle swarm optimization for association rules using the itemset range and correlation coefficient). Our method uses set particle swarm optimization to generate association rules from a database and considers both positive and negative occurrences of attributes. SARIC applies the itemset range and correlation coefficient so that we do not need to specify the minimum support and confidence, because it automatically determines them quickly and objectively. We verified the efficiency of SARIC using two differently sized databases. Our simulation results demonstrate that SARIC generates more promising results than Apriori, Eclat, HMINE, and a genetic algorithm.",

It acts both as an enabler and driver of new, technical, economic and societal developments. With recent achievements in areas such as machine learning, Internet of Things or artificial intelligence (or rather intelligent assistancea probably more appropriate term), we see the power of computer science. In this short comment, we argue that IT and tourism is still a hot topic, also or especially from a scientific point of view.

The analyzed variables are independent variables that characterize the level of development of human and machine labor in the economy of a country; dependent variables that reflect the effectiveness of the production, marketing and innovative business processes in the economy of country according to The Global Competitiveness Report (World Economic Forum); and dependent variables, which show the share of the sphere (agriculture, mining industry, processing industry and service sphere) in the structure of GDP of a country according to the statistics of the World Bank. For determining the change of regression dependencies in dynamics in the interests of reduction of the probability of statistical error, the research is conducted for 2010 and 2018 with application of trend analysis. Findings Based on the full selection of modern countries that conduct digital modernization, the authors determine statistical dependencies of effectiveness of business processes and development of the spheres of economy on the intensity of application of machine and human labor. This allowed determining significant differences in automatization of business processes: perspectives of application of machine labor are the widest in production and the narrowest in marketing, differentiated logic of organization of intellectual production in different spheres of economy and the specifics of automatization of business processes and spheres of economy in countries of different categories, one of which has to be taken into account during organization of intellectual production in Industry 4.0.

For this purpose, it is necessary to study and to introduce approaches able to establish the lack of products on the shelves and thereby promptly ensuring their repositioning. In this context, the paper investigates the use of artificial intelligence techniques in detecting the out-of-shelf products. Particularly, having sales data, ordering info and product assortment of the store available, we study the development of low cost shelf detector that is based on wireless sensor network, and that can automatically discover out-of-shelf situations on a daily basis for all the stores of a retail chain. The use of an automatic method for detecting products that are not available on the shelf based on sales data would offer an accurate view of the shelf availability, both to retailers and to product suppliers. The tool presented is the first being installed for a long time in a high number of stores and products demonstrating the ability to gather data from there and extract interesting insights. This paper aims to present the hardware infrastructure of an embedded sensor network devoted to real time shelf out-of-stock management and to demonstrate the feasibility and the scalability of the system in providing a lot of data and interesting insights for store team and brand's marketing team.",

It closes a gap in the literature by defining better the benefits and the impact of digitalization on the speed of internationalization regarding the international market evaluation process. Furthermore, it outlines why and how digitalization is important throughout the internationalization process. The paper opted for a multiple case-study research design using different sources of evidence, including 51 responses from senior managers of lean, global, start-up firms (LGS). The revised Uppsala internationalization process model was used as the theoretical framework to analyze the impact of digitalization on the speed of the LGS internationalization. The paper provides empirical insights about the impact of digitalization on the speed of LGS internationalization. Digitalization allows LGS to increase decision-making efficiency and to optimize international market evaluation strategies and processes. It suggests that international managers act as integrating forces on several levels: by applying a disciplined and structured internationalization process with regular reviews, by mediating between local market realities and corporate goals, understanding the limits and benefits of digitalization, and optimizing decision-making. The findings are relevant for researchers and scholars, who support activities that promote digital engagement, to understand better the impact of digitalization on the speed of LGS internationalization. This paper fulfills an identified need and a call for research to study the impact of digitalization on the speed of LGS internationalization.",

However, with the advance of technology, the scope of eco-innovation becomes larger and complicated. In the past, very few articles discussed the evolution of technologies involving eco-innovation integratedly and systematically. It is worth to have a systematic review concerning the state of the art. The purpose of this study was to provide a holistic view to see the progression of the technologies which pushed forward the realization of sustainability in the past 2-3 decades. In this study, 55 research review papers were initially selected and analyzed to identify the technologies involving eco-innovation. Four technology-based eco-innovation dimensions were defined (green/sustainable product development dimension, business model integration dimension, green marketing and sustainable consumption dimension, and hybrid model construction and optimization dimension). Five case studies in the prior research were re-evaluated based on the identified technology-based eco-innovation dimensions. The results showed that most companies performed the best for the green/sustainable product development dimension. New technology and directions are needed for enterprises to strengthen the other three dimensions. Therefore, additional 76 papers were analyzed to provide suggestions concerning future technology directions for enterprises moving towards sustainability. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A precise account of success is given, in order to sieve out aspects pertaining to marketing or sociology of research, and the remaining aspects seem to certify a genuine value of deep learning, calling for explanation. The alleged two main propelling factors for deep learning, namely computing hardware performance and neuroscience findings, are scrutinized, and evaluated as relevant but insufficient for a comprehensive explanation. We review various attempts that have been made to provide mathematical foundations able to justify the efficiency of deep learning, and we deem this is the most promising road to follow, even if the current achievements are too scattered and relevant for very limited classes of deep neural models. The authors' take is that most of what can explain the very nature of why deep learning works at all and even very well across so many domains of application is still to be understood and further research, which addresses the theoretical foundation of artificial learning, is still very much needed.",

   "content": "In food products marketing, ensuring to the consumer identical organoleptic properties is vital for maintaining the client fidelity. Systematically achieve it by using as sensory information the valuations of a tasting panel, is unfeasible. Routinely, to assemble a tasting panel involves organizational and economics costs, as well as the sensory fatigue and the subjectivity of the panel members. In this paper is proposed a vitualization strategy or computational model focused on food products quality control, based on cooperation and data exchange between the main agents involved in the process: quality managers, professional tasters, production managers, inspection authorities, etc. Virtualization (digitalization) is supported on a ICatador cloud platform which has intelligent algorithms embedded to predict the food sensory properties. These algorithms have Near InfraRed Spectroscopy data of the product samples as input. As a validation scenario, our virtualization approach has been applied to the ripening cheese elaboration. Thanks to advanced visualization techniques, the quality manager can immediately and systematically know the merit figure related to a product sensory quality. The ICatador solution, has two profitable aspects. Sensory analysis is performed without routinely gathering a professional tasting panel. As a huge amount of data coming from the elaboration process itself are available, the intelligent algorithms are enriched by these data for the adaptation to the product elaboration process. In this way, we will be able to fine-tune continuously the machine-learning algorithms to the particular process and use them intelligently to increase the competitiveness.",

   "content": "Immunosuppressive treatment strategies for autoimmune diseases have changed drastically with the development of targeted therapies. While targeted therapies have changed the way we manage immune mediated diseases, their use has been attended by a variety of infectious complications-some expected, others unexpected. This perspective examines lessons learned from the use of different targeted therapies over the past several decades, and reviews existing strategies to minimize infectious risk. Several of these infectious complications were predictable in the light of preclinical models and early clinical trials (i.e., tuberculosis and TNF inhibitors; meningococcus; and eculizumab). While these scenarios can potentially help us in terms of enhancing our predictive powers (higher vigilance, earlier detection, and risk mitigation), targeted therapies have also revealed unpredictable toxicities (i.e., natalizumab and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy). Severe infectious complications, even if rare, can derail a promising therapeutic and highlight the need for increased awareness and meticulous adjudication. Tools are available to help mitigate infectious risks. The first step is to ensure that infection safety is adequately studied at every level of drug development prior to regulatory approval, with adequate post-marketing surveillance including registries that collect real-world adverse events in a collaborative effort. The second step is to identify high risk patients (using risk calculators such as the RABBIT risk score; big data analyses; artificial intelligence). Finally, the most underutilized interventions to prevent severe infections in patients receiving targeted therapies across the spectrum of immune mediated inflammatory diseases are vaccinations.",

The need for a legal framework to protect the general public's data is not new, yet it is not clear whether recent changes in data protection law in Europe, with the introduction of the GDPR, have highlighted the importance of privacy and led to a healthy concern from the general public over online user tracking and use of data. Like search engines, social media and online shopping platforms, intelligent tutoring systems aim to personalize learning and thus also rely on algorithms that automatically profile individual learner traits. A number of studies have been published on user perceptions of trust in robots and computer agents. Unsurprisingly, studies of AI in education have focused on efficacy, so the extent of learner awareness, and acceptance, of tracking and profiling algorithms remains unexplored. This paper discusses the ethical and legal considerations for, and presents a case study examining the general public's views of, AI in education. A survey was recently taken of attendees at a national science festival event highlighting state-of-the-art AI technologies in education. Whilst most participants (77%) were worried about the use of their data, in learning systems fewer than 8% of adults were 'not happy' being tracked, as opposed to nearly two-thirds (63%) of children surveyed.",

   "content": "Smart media combines media and artificial intelligence (AI) and can also be a user-centered content service market. However, existing research lacks an understanding of user's perceptions concerning smart services generated by different user experience types across different payment groups. Taking AI-powered Smart TV (AI TV) as a typical research object, this study (1) develops a theoretical model by integrating the technology acceptance model with users' smart service belief factors and (2) employs the user experience type as an original moderator. Using data from 585 AI TV users, the structural equation modeling analysis suggests that perceived two-way communication, perceived personalization, and perceived co-creation as three belief factors, are important antecedent constructs in the extended technology acceptance model. The analysis also suggests that the user experience type exerts positive moderating effects on two-way communication and personalization to attitude toward behavior and purchase intention. This study thus contributes to the literature on smart service by identifying and studying smart service belief factors. The addition of smart service belief factors as antecedents, as well as user experience type as a moderator, are crucial to expand the generalizability of TAM to the smart media service context. From a customer experience management perspective, this study shows how to convert ad-supported users into new paid subscribers, while keeping existing subscribers by fulfilling their smart service requirements.",

Focusing on Paraguay as a representative context, a multiple-case-study research design was adopted using different sources of evidence, including 15 in-depth interviews with founders, shareholders, and CEOs. The data were analyzed using grounded theory in order to develop patterns and categories, and to understand differences and regularities. The revised Uppsala internationalization process model was used as a theoretical framework. This article highlights the experts' views of the impact of business intelligence on the export performance of software firms in Paraguay. Although only a few of the interviewees currently use business intelligence solutions to support international strategic decision-making processes, most of them reveal a desire to use them because they expect it will have a positive impact on export performance and international competitiveness. The main factors for selecting a business intelligence solution are transparency of cost and benefits, excellent client service, and an attractive pricing model. The study results apply to all stakeholders who support the impact of business intelligence systems on the export performance of software firms in emerging economies. The article fulfils an identified need and call for research to study the use and impact of business intelligence on the way an emerging country's exportation of goods actually performs, and the ability of its software firms to globalize successfully.",

   "content": "Eye tracking technology allows researchers to monitor position of the eye and infer one's gaze direction, which is used to understand the nature of human attention within psychology, cognitive science, marketing and artificial intelligence. Commercially available head-mounted eye trackers allow researchers to track pupil movements (saccades and fixations) using infrared camera and capture the field of vision by a front-facing scene camera. The wearable eye tracker opened a new way to research in unconstrained environment settings; however, the recorded scene video typically has non-uniform illumination, low quality image frames, and moving scene objects. One of the most important tasks for analyzing the recorded scene video data is finding the boundary between different objects in a single frame. This paper presents a multi-level fixation-oriented object segmentation method (MFoOS) to solve the above challenges in segmenting the scene objects in video data collected by the eye tracker in order to support cognition research. MFoOS shows its advancement in position-invariance, illumination, noise tolerance and is task-driven. The proposed method is tested using real-world case studies designed by our team of psychologists focused on understanding visual attention in human problem solving. The extensive computer simulation demonstrates the method's accuracy and robustness for fixation-oriented object segmentation. Moreover, a deep-learning image semantic segmentation combining MFoOS results as label data was explored to demonstrate the possibility of on-line deployment of eye tracker fixation-oriented object segmentation.",

   "content": "Quantitative analysis for forecasting in business and marketing, especially in consumer behaviour and consumer decision-making process (consumer choice modelling), has become more poplar in business practices. The ability to understand and to accurately predict the consumer decision can lead to more effectively target the products (and/or services), cost effectiveness in marketing strategies, increasing in sale and result in substantial improvement in the overall profitability of the firm. Conventional econometric models, such as discriminant analysis and logistic regression have been used to predict consumer choices. However, in recent years, there has been a growing interest in applying artificial neural networks (ANN) to analyse consumer behaviour and to model the consumer decision-making process. Neural networks are considered as a field of artificial intelligence. The development of the models was inspired by the neural architecture of human brain. Neural networks have been generally applied to two different categories of problems recognition problems and generalisation problems. Recognition problems include visual applications such as learning to recognize particular words and speak them. Generalization problems include classification and prediction problems. ANN have been applied in many disciplines, including biology, psychology, statistics, mathematics, medical science, and computer science. Recently ANNs have been applied to a variety of business areas such as accounting, finance, management and decision making, marketing, and production. However, the technique has been sparsely used in modelling consumer choices. For example, Dasgupta et al. (1994) compared the performance of discriminant analysis and logistic regression models against an ANN model with respect to their ability to identify consumer segment based upon their willingness to take financial risks and to purchase a non-traditional investment product. The purpose of this paper is to empirically compare the predictive power of the probability neural network (PNN), a special class of neural networks, and the MLFN with the logistic model on consumers' banking choices between electronic banking and non-electronic banking. Data for this analysis was obtained through a mail survey sent to 1,960 household in New Zealand. The questionnaire gathered information on consumers' decision to use electronic banking versus non-electronic banking. The factors include service quality dimensions, perceived risk factors, user input factors, price factors, service product characteristics, and individual factors. In addition, demographic variables including age, gender, marital status, ethnic background, educational qualification, employment, income, and area of residence are considered. Empirical results showed that both ANN models (MLFN and PNN) exhibit a higher overall percentage correct on consumer choice predictions than the logistic model. Furthermore, the PNN demonstrates to be the best predictive model since it has the highest overall percentage correct and a very low percentage error on both Type I and Type II errors.",

   "content": "Purpose The rapid growth of technology, including artificial intelligence (AI), in the banking industry has played a disrupting role in traditional banking channels. This study aims to investigate factors that influence the attitudes and perceptions of digital natives pertaining to mobile banking and comfort interacting with AI-enabled mobile banking activities. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 218 digital natives. This paper uses multivariate regression and two separate multiple regression analyses to examine the differential effects of technology-based (i.e. attitudes toward AI, relative advantage, perceived trust and security in specific mobile banking activities) and non-technology based (i.e. need for service, quality of service) factors on mobile banking usage and AI-enabled mobile banking services. Findings This study identifies determining factors for mobile banking and AI-enabled mobile banking services. Results indicate a divide in how digital natives perceive relative advantage between our two dependent variables. Consistent with previous studies, the relative advantage construct has the most impact on mobile banking usage. However, relative advantage was not significant for AI-enabled mobile banking, suggesting an extra layer of complexity that goes beyond convenient fast banking. Research limitations/implications A limitation of this study is that it does not incorporate age groups outside of digital natives. Further research is needed to test for differential effects between age groups. In addition, the discovery of no significant impact of relative advantage on AI mobile banking warrants more research on the similarities and differences between mobile banking and AI-enabled mobile banking. Practical implications To better appeal to digital natives, it is suggested that the banking industry emphasize mobile banking's anywhere/anytime access to financial accounts, as this is important to college-age customers who may not live near their local banking institution. Moreover, the paper suggests that improvement to mobile banking features for one-on-one interpersonal contact with bank employees is needed. Originality/value This study addresses the gap in the understanding of how digital natives perceive mobile banking in comparison to AI-enabled mobile banking services.",

The revolutions in genomic and personalized medicine, artificial intelligence and biotechnology will transform the medicine of tomorrow and the organization of our health system. It is therefore fundamental that France prepares for these changes and supports the development of its companies in these new areas. The recent Conseil strategique des industries de sante launched by Matignon makes it possible to propose a regulatory arsenal conducive to the implementation and diffusion of therapeutic innovations. In this workshop, we present a number of proposals, our approach having remained pragmatic with a permanent concern to be effective in the short term for the patients and to simplify the procedures as much as possible. This was achieved thanks to the participation in this workshop of most of the players involved (industrial companies, Agence nationale de securite du medicament et des produits de sante, Haute Autorite de sante, Institut national du cancer, Les entreprises du medicament, hospitals, Observatoire du medicament, des dispositifs medicaux et de l'innovation therapeutique...). The main proposals tend to favor the implementation of clinical trials on our territory, especially the early phases, a wider access to innovations by favoring early access programs and setting up a process called autorisation temporaire d'utilisation d'extension (ATUext) that make it possible to prescribe a medicinal product even if the latter has a marketing authorisation in another indication. In addition, we propose a conditional reimbursement that will be available based on preliminary data but will require re-evaluation based on consolidated data from clinical trials and/or real-life data. Finally, in order to better carry out these assessments, with a view to access or care, we propose the establishment of partnership agreements with health agencies/hospitals in order to encourage the emergence of field experts, in order to prioritize an ascending expertise closer to patients needs and to real life.

This suggests that understanding how mobile consumers use smartphones for fashion shopping is important in developing digital shopping platforms that fulfil consumer' expectations. Design/methodology/approach For this research, mobile eye-tracking technology was employed in order to develop unique shopping journeys for 30 consumers, using fashion retailers' websites on smartphones, documenting their differences and similarities in browsing and purchasing behaviour. Findings Based on scan path visualisations and observed shopping experiences, three prominent mobile shopping journeys and shopper types were identified: directed by retailer's website, efficient self-selected journey and challenging shopper. These prominent behaviour patterns were used to characterise mixed cluster behaviours; three distinct mixed clusters were identified, namely, extended self-selected journey, challenging shoppers directed by retailer's website and focused challenging shopper. Research limitations/implications This research argues that mobile consumers can be segmented based on their activities and behaviours on the mobile website. Knowing the prominent shopping behaviour types any other complex behaviour patterns can be identified, analysed and described. Practical implications The findings of this research can be used in developing personalised shopping experiences on smartphones by feeding these shopper types into retailers' digital marketing strategy and artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Originality/value This paper contributes to consumer behaviour literature by proposing a novel mobile consumer segmentation approach based on detailed shopping journey analysis using mobile eye-tracking technology.",

This work sets labels for existing electricity consumption behaviors to carry out the classification of unknown types of electricity consumption behavior. Power big data-based artificial intelligence or data mining methods, which can be used to analyze electricity consumption behavior, have been widely applied to provide targeted marketing services for electricity consumers. However, the traditional clustering algorithm has difficulty in judging new electricity consumption patterns. Deep neural networks usually need large amounts of labeled data. However, there are few comparable electricity consumption features or basic data, and the labeled data cannot meet the actual needs. Therefore, an intelligent classification framework for electricity consumption behavior based on an improved k-means and long short-term memory (LSTM) is proposed, which not only extracts features effectively, but also establishes a mapping relationship between unlabeled electricity consumption behavior characteristics and user types. The features can be labeled to train the deep neural network to judge the electricity consumption behavior of new users. Firstly, nine typical characteristics were selected from aspects including electricity price sensitivity and load fluctuation rate. Secondly, the k value and initial clustering centers of the k-means algorithm were optimized. Thirdly, the users were labelled based on the clustering results, together with the features, and a dataset was formed, which was input into LSTM to train the classification model. Finally, the analysis of users in Shenyang, China, showed the results based on the proposed method were consistent with the actual situation. Moreover, compared to other methods, the efficiency and accuracy were higher.",

Nonetheless, the issues surrounding AI services remain relatively unknown. The purpose for this paper is to offer a digital servitization framework for understanding how AI services impact value perceptions, consumer engagement and firm performance measures. The authors use the financial service ecosystem to explore this topic. Design/methodology/approach The authors explore relevant literature on digital servitization, service-dominant logic and AI/disruptive innovation. Next, a conceptual framework, organized by AI-Service Exchange Antecedents, Context of AI Usage and Digital Servitization Consequences, is developed. The authors conceptualize consequences for consumers and firms. Findings The main findings suggest that the linkages between consumers, financial institutions and fintech companies with AI usage in a service ecosystem should be identified; how value is created among multiple SD Logic-AI network actors should be analyzed; and the effects of AI-consumer interactions (lower-level and higher levels of engagement) on firm performance measures should be explored. Research limitations/implications The conceptual framework identifies gaps in the literature and suggests research questions for future studies. Practical implications This paper may assist practitioners with the development of AI-enabled banking activities that involve direct consumer engagement. Originality/value To the authors' best knowledge, this research agenda is the first comprehensive framework for understanding value co-creation in the context of AI in financial services, linking antecedents, usage and consequences.",

The digitalization of new foreign market development helps them to more efficiently identify new market opportunities in global markets. With this approach, they are saving resources while developing the most attractive markets. This article examines how lean global startups develop new foreign markets more rapidly due to digitalization. Thus, the aim is to understand the impact of digitalization on speed of internationalization of lean global startups. The study addresses a gap in the scholarly literature and a practical need to evaluate new foreign markets and business opportunities more quickly and more regularly and to understand what helps lean global startups react more quickly to opportunities and threats with respect to changing market attractiveness. Furthermore, it outlines why and how digitalization is important throughout the internationalization process. The research followed a multiple case-study design using different sources of evidence, including 73 interviews with senior managers of lean global startups. The findings reveal that digitalization allows lean global startups to increase decision-making efficiency and to optimize strategies and processes for evaluating international markets. The findings suggest that lean global startups can benefit from the use of digital technologies by applying a more efficient foreign market development process with regular reviews and a reduced workflow, by faster mediation between local market realities and strategic goals, by analyzing all foreign markets instead of just a sample of them, and by optimizing decision-making processes including the ability to make long-term, strategic decisions due to better market information.",

   "content": "A remarkable amount of Twitter messages are generated every second. Detecting the location entities mentioned in these messages is useful in text mining applications. Therefore, techniques for extracting the location entities from the Twitter textual content are needed. In this work, we approach this task in a similar manner to the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task, but we focus only on locations, while NER systems detect names of persons, organizations, locations, and sometimes more (e.g., dates, times). But, unlike NER systems, we address a deeper task: classifying the detected locations into names of cities, provinces/states, and countries in order to map them into physical locations. We approach the task in a novel way, consisting in two stages. In the first stage, we train Conditional Random Fields (CRF) models that are able to detect the locations mentioned in the messages. We train three classifiers: one for cities, one for provinces/states, and one for countries, with various sets of features. Since a dataset annotated with this kind of information was not available, we collected and annotated our own dataset to use for training and testing. In the second stage, we resolve the remaining ambiguities, namely, cases when there exists more than one place with the same name. We proposed a set of heuristics able to choose the correct physical location in these cases. Our two-stage model will allow a social media monitoring system to visualize the places mentioned in Twitter messages on a map of the world or to compute statistics about locations. This kind of information can be of interest to business or marketing applications.",

   "content": "With strict protections and regulations of data privacy and security, conventional machine learning based on centralized datasets is confronted with significant challenges, making artificial intelligence (AI) impractical in many mission-critical and data-sensitive scenarios, such as finance, government, and health. In the meantime, tremendous datasets are scattered in isolated silos in various industries, organizations, different units of an organization, or different branches of an international organization. These valuable data resources are well underused. To advance AI theories and applications, we propose a comprehensive framework (called Knowledge Federation - KF) to address these challenges by enabling AI while preserving data privacy and ownership. Beyond the concepts of federated learning and secure multi-party computation, KF consists of four levels of federation: (1) information level, low-level statistics and computation of data, meeting the requirements of simple queries, searching and simplistic operators; (2) model level, supporting training, learning, and inference; (3) cognition level, enabling abstract feature representation at various levels of abstractions and contexts; (4) knowledge level, fusing knowledge discovery, representation, and reasoning. We further clarify the relationship and differentiation between knowledge federation and other related research areas. We have developed a reference implementation of KF, called iBond Platform, to offer a productionquality KF platform to enable industrial applications in finance, insurance, marketing, and government. The iBond platform will also help establish the KF community and a comprehensive ecosystem and usher in a novel paradigm shift towards secure, privacy-preserving and responsible AI. As far as we know, knowledge federation is the first hierarchical and unified framework for secure multi-party computing (statistics, queries, searching, and low-level operations) and learning (training, representation, discovery, inference, and reasoning).",

   "content": "In this paper, the discourse on disruptive innovation and growth hacking is applied to concepts and approaches in the sustainability of performing arts. One of the principal applications of art is to reach an audience. Presentational art forms such as music, dance, and theatre have traditionally relied on word of mouth, newspaper, radio and television advertisements to reach broader audiences. In the era of disruptive innovation, however, technology platforms guided by artificial intelligence, data input and algorithms play a significant role in determining what content appears in front of users. For many emerging artists, finding an audience in the era of disruption means funneling through just five technology platforms that generate 80% of global mobile advertising revenue [1]. How do Southeast Asian performing artists reach their audiences in a consumer-based society that is increasingly dependent on the immersive technology of computers and hand-held devices? Carefully designed cooperation between creative artists and growth hacking experts has the potential to help artists reach virtual and live audiences. Growth hacking, a process of rapid experimentation to identify the most efficient ways to grow, is particularly prevalent among startups and smaller businesses. Using the analogy of performers as small business, I explore the efforts of such arts as Kelantanese shadow puppetry, Balinese marching bands and cartoon satire to use unconventional marketing techniques where data analysis and creativity merge. Given that just five tech platforms are deciding what type of content is seen and why this oligopoly shapes audience preferences that tend to lean toward aesthetic uniformity. To counter this, I argue that an alliance between strategic growth hacking and creative artists has the potential to empower diversity in the performing arts of Southeast Asia.",

This introductory article to the special issue's third and final part comes in three sections. In Section 1, we summarize the six papers that appear in this part. In Section 2, we give a wrap-up of the lessons learned. Specifically, we discuss (i) why studying the recognition heuristic has led to so much controversy, making it difficult to settle on mutually accepted empirically grounded assumptions, (ii) whether the development of the recognition heuristic and its theoretical descriptions could explain some of the past controversies and misconceptions, (iii) how additional cue knowledge about unrecognized objects could enter the decision process, (iv) why recognition heuristic theory should be complemented by a probabilistic model of strategy selection, and (v) how recognition information might be related to other information, especially when considering real-world applications. In Section 3, we present an outlook on the thorny but fruitful road to cumulative theory integration. Future research on recognition-based inferences should (i) converge on overcoming past controversies, taking an integrative approach to theory building, and considering theories and findings from neighboring fields (such as marketing science and artificial intelligence), (ii) build detailed computational process models of decision strategies, grounded in cognitive architectures, (iii) test existing models of such strategies competitively, (iv) design computational models of the mechanisms of strategy selection, and (v) effectively extend its scope to decision making in the wild, outside controlled laboratory situations.",

   "Author Keywords": "conceptual design; case-based reasoning; hypermedia information systems",
   "content": "Conceptual design requires processing information from diverse sources in order to define the functional requirements, operating constraints, and evaluation criteria pertinent to accomplishing a prescribed goal. Historically, the design process focused on the functionality of an artifact for the end customer. Concurrent engineering broadens this focus to account for the concerns of 'customers' not previously considered - those along the entire life cycle of an artifact, i.e. marketing, design, manufacture, distribution, operation and disposal. Expanding the design focus to include all of these customers places far greater informational demands on the designer. Case-based reasoning applies experience stored in a computerized form to solving similar problems in slightly altered contexts. It has been applied successfully to routine design where both the form and the content of design information can be encoded symbolically and manipulated using artificial intelligence techniques. Concurrent conceptual design presents unique problems for such an approach because design information must be considered at many levels of abstraction and from many viewpoints. We describe an approach that provides the designer with case-based conceptual design information stored in the richly expressive medium of hypermedia (hypertext incorporating multimedia). Design cases of industry 'best practices' in concurrent engineering are indexed to provide access through multiple interfaces, allowing the user to browse, explore, or pinpoint design case information. The Conceptual Design Information Server (CDIS) is implemented using emerging internet standards, such as those associated with the World Wide Web (WWW) and Wide Area Information Service (WAIS), coupled to a robust Structured Query Language (SQL) database and traditional CAD packages.

   "content": "Professor Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady said, 'Why can't a woman be more like a man?' Perhaps unintended, such narration extends to the reality of current drug development. A clear sex-gap exists in pharmaceutical research spanning from preclinical studies, clinical trials to post-marketing surveillance with a bias towards males. Consequently, women experience adverse drug reactions from approved drug products more often than men. Distinct differences in pharmaceutical response across drug classes and the lack of understanding of disease pathophysiology also exists between the sexes, often leading to suboptimal drug therapy in women. This review explores the influence of sex as a biological variable in drug delivery, pharmacokinetic response and overall efficacy in the context of pharmaceutical research and practice in the clinic. Prospective recommendations are provided to guide researchers towards the consideration of sex differences in methodologies and analyses. The promotion of disaggregating data according to sex to strengthen scientific rigour, encouraging innovation through the personalisation of medicines and adopting machine learning algorithms is vital for optimised drug development in the sexes and population health equity.

   "content": "Purpose Tags help promote customer engagement on video-sharing platforms. Video tag recommender systems are artificial intelligence-enabled frameworks that strive for recommending precise tags for videos. Extant video tag recommender systems are uninterpretable, which leads to distrust of the recommendation outcome, hesitation in tag adoption and difficulty in the system debugging process. This study aims at constructing an interpretable and novel video tag recommender system to assist video-sharing platform users in tagging their newly uploaded videos. Design/methodology/approach The proposed interpretable video tag recommender system is a multimedia deep learning framework composed of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which receives texts and images as inputs. The interpretability of the proposed system is realized through layer-wise relevance propagation. Findings The case study and user study demonstrate that the proposed interpretable multimedia CNN model could effectively explain its recommended tag to users by highlighting keywords and key patches that contribute the most to the recommended tag. Moreover, the proposed model achieves an improved recommendation performance by outperforming state-of-the-art models. Practical implications The interpretability of the proposed recommender system makes its decision process more transparent, builds users' trust in the recommender systems and prompts users to adopt the recommended tags. Through labeling videos with human-understandable and accurate tags, the exposure of videos to their target audiences would increase, which enhances information technology (IT) adoption, customer engagement, value co-creation and precision marketing on the video-sharing platform. Originality/value The proposed model is not only the first explainable video tag recommender system but also the first explainable multimedia tag recommender system to the best of our knowledge.",

   "content": "Image Classification (IC) is most prominent among other Artificial Intelligence (AI) domains. Mainly, IC participates rigorously for the development of society in a variety of application areas such as finance, marketing, health, industrial automation, education, and safety and security. Typically, an IC model takes image input data and tunes itself as per the required application task and classify accordingly. Among the various categories of images, color image category is better due to the capability of capturing more details, which are essential for classification purpose. However, the modern world demands Realtime or online image classification, which involves Imagery Streams. The highly likely uncertainty in Imagery Streams is due to non-stationary environment, for example, certain features or class boundaries which are valid at one-time step are not adequate for another time step. These uncertainties in Imagery Streams have deleterious effects on IC models, which causes performance degradation in terms of accuracy or make IC models, not in further use. Therefore, to overcome these issues, IC models need to adapt to changes caused by uncertainties in Imagery Streams. This paper focuses on the understanding the possible scenarios of such uncertainties in Color Imagery Streams, investigates the deleterious effects due to changes in Color Imagery Streams and provides the possible mitigation approach to overcome the issues in IC models. The contribution of this research is the first step towards an adaptive model development to mitigate the deleterious effects of uncertainty in Color Imagery Streams. This model will benefit many application areas and will directly contribute to the daily life of a society.",

   "content": "With the fourth industrial revolution emerging as a requirement of the global production network, companies and countries are connected more tightly through supply chain networks around the world. The fourth industrial revolution Industry 4.0 means that all innovations in digital technology mature, especially in the manufacturing sector, during the transformation process. These technologies are especially advanced internet, artificial intelligence and robotics, advanced sensor technology, cloud technology that accelerates data transfer and utilization, digital fabrication (3D printing), new services and marketing models, smart phones, and algorithms for navigation tools, delivery and ride services and autonomous vehicles. All these elements are included in the global value chain so that they can be shared by many companies from many countries. So, in the fourth industrial revolution, there are different technologies that are brought together for different but the same purpose. It is therefore becoming more complex to organize global organizations that are global, interconnected, and international. Industry 4.0 brings new dimensions both qualitative and quantitative within the companies that have used the new automation technologies for years and have experience and knowledge. Industry 4.0 has a complex nature beyond the modern production management system (MES) and world class production (WCM). The aim of this study is to show that the concept of project management in the Industry 4.0 approach, where large-scale physical and virtual worlds are tried to be brought together, is particularly affected by this change in the manufacturing sector. With this study, it is stated that changing the project management approach is a necessity. Moreover, this interaction is also discussed for industrial facilities.",

In interacting with the design support system, designers may face problems such as changing demands (e.g. unclear demands) and insufficient descriptions of these demands (e.g. data scarcity). The purpose of this paper is to build a design support system prototype for demonstrating the feasibility of meeting the high involvement of users in digital products. Design/methodology/approach - Interactive evolutionary computation is applied. Findings - A prototype of self-design greeting card system (SDGCS) was proposed. It provides professional design layouts, offers users numerous self-design models, and allows nonprofessional users to easily design greeting cards. The results of this study show that users were satisfied with the functionality, usefulness, and ease-of-use of the SDGCS. Research limitations/implications - This study used digital card design as an example for demonstrating the feasibility of satisfying the unclear needs of uses, enabling users to design a digital card creatively and complete their designs quickly. However, the current system only supports the design of static objects and layout of card. And the evaluation sample size was small, which might affect generalizability of the findings. Practical implications - In practice, greeting card web operators can image the feasible business models by providing the attraction of self-design functionalities. Originality/value - In current human-centric marketing era, consumers have begun to request interaction with designers in creating the value of a product. However, very few previous studies have provided support for digital product self-design. This study demonstrated the feasibility of satisfying the needs of self-design.",

   "content": "This research builds on prior work on developing near optimal solutions to the product line design problems within the conjoint analysis framework. In this research, we investigate and compare different genetic algorithm operators; in particular, we examine systematically the impact of employing alternative population maintenance strategies and mutation techniques within our problem context. Two alternative population maintenance methods, that we term Emigration and Malthusian strategies, are deployed to govern how individual product lines in one generation are carried over to the next generation. We also allow for two different types of reproduction methods termed Equal Opportunity in which the parents to be paired for mating are selected with equal opportunity and a second based on always choosing the best string in the current generation as one of the parents which is referred to as the Queen bee, while the other parent is randomly selected from the set of parent strings. We also look at the impact of integrating the artificial intelligence approach with a traditional optimization approach by seeding the GA with solutions obtained from a Dynamic Programming heuristic proposed by others. A detailed statistical analysis is also carried out to determine the impact of various problem and technique aspects on multiple measures of performance through means of a Monte Carlo simulation study. Our results indicate that such proposed procedures are able to provide multiple good solutions. This provides more flexibility for the decision makers as they now have the opportunity to select from a number of very good product lines. The results obtained using our approaches are encouraging, with statistically significant improvements averaging 5% or more, when compared to the traditional benchmark of the heuristic dynamic programming technique.

   "content": "The Web is evolving through an era where the opinions of users are getting increasingly important and valuable. The distillation of knowledge from the huge amount of unstructured information on the Web can be a key factor for tasks such as social media marketing, branding, product positioning, and corporate reputation management. These online social data, however, remain hardly accessible to computers, as they are specifically meant for human consumption. The automatic analysis of online opinions involves a deep understanding of natural language text by machines, from which we are still very far. To this end, concept-level sentiment analysis aims to go beyond a mere word-level analysis of text and provide novel approaches to opinion mining and sentiment analysis that enable a more efficient passage from (unstructured) textual information to (structured) machine-processable data. A recent knowledge-based technology in this context is sentic computing, which relies on the ensemble application of common-sense computing and the psychology of emotions to infer the conceptual and affective information associated with natural language. Sentic computing, however, is limited by the richness of the knowledge base and by the fact that the bag-of-concepts model, despite more sophisticated than bag-of-words, misses out important discourse structure information that is key for properly detecting the polarity conveyed by natural language opinions. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm to concept-level sentiment analysis that merges linguistics, common-sense computing, and machine learning for improving the accuracy of tasks such as polarity detection. By allowing sentiments to flow from concept to concept based on the dependency relation of the input sentence, in particular, we achieve a better understanding of the contextual role of each concept within the sentence and, hence, obtain a polarity detection engine that outperforms state-of-the-art statistical methods.

Blockchain by itself is a database with certain special characteristics but the potential that this technology acquires with the implementation of intelligent contracts leads us to the conceptualization of intelligent property, internet of things, artificial intelligence, intelligent cities, tokenization of physical assets and properties. This last concept also triggers the possibility of issuing tokens linked to undertakings with sustainable development objectives or green tokens. The tokenization of digital goods has developed naturally, but the pitfalls -more mental than legal and technological- are present in the tokenization of physical assets, and we will address them in this paper. Del Castillo Ionov says: tokenization involves taking an asset and, using blockchain technology, issuing tokens representative of that asset, facilitating its negotiation, the enjoyment of the rights of that asset and its governance. The tokenization of digital assets has developed naturally, but the pitfalls - more mental than legal and technological - are present in the tokenization of physical assets. Since tokenization of real estate is technologically possible, we are left wondering whether this technological advance is received by legal systems or, in light of the interpretation of existing rules, whether it can be applied. The aim of this paper is to show that real estate tokenization is not only technologically possible but also possible to be implemented in the light of the regulations in force in some legal systems. It believes that the tokenization of physical assets will allow a new field of action, marketing, transmission, circulation of rights and wealth, as well as a new range of opportunities not only for all legal operators but also for the great mass of capital investors interested in sustainable development, as well as for the home retail investor.",

While Artificial intelligence is a simulation of the cognitive approach, RPA is merely mimicking that process by the use of bots. RPA and IA are emerging and transforming bus inesses across various sectors such as finance and accounting, payroll, human resources, supply chain, customer service, sales and marketing, IT etc.[5] One such industry where bots are being used for automating processes is the food and lifestyle industry. Various applications like healthify me and room suggest users a diet based on their specifications like height, weight, age, gender etc. Some of these applications make use of E-mail automation to suggest users with a user-specific, specially curated diet at timed intervals(daily/weekly/ monthly..). Various tools such as Automation Anywhere, Blue prism, UI-Path, Pega etc.[4] are used to create bots and automate tasks/compute algorithms. The tool used for the creation of this diet recommendation system is Automation Anywhere. By making use of automation anywhere, a recommender system is created that can act as a meal planner. There are three types of bots in Automation Anywhere - task bots, meta bots and IQ bots. Task bots need to be edited manually with application updates. Metabots on the other hand, are more advanced. They are designed in such a way that bot-recalibration is automatically applied with changes in the application interface. IQ bots use cognitive technology when working with unstructured data[11]. Here, For this particular application, taskbots and metabots are used. The proposed solution is capable of sending a large number of diet recommendations to hundreds of users in a database at a very expeditious rate.",

   "content": "Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using Twitter polls to assess public opinion regarding session content at a national specialty society meeting. Methods: Twitter polls allow users to embed multiple-choice questions within tweets and automatically aggregate responses. Two radiologists attending the 2016 annual meeting of the ACR posted a Twitter poll containing the hashtag #ACR2016 during 10 meeting sessions addressing socioeconomics/advocacy, patient experience, and social media/informatics (20 polls total). Each poll contained a question asking for an opinion regarding the session's content. Polls were open for responses for 24 hours. Results: The average number of responses per poll was significantly higher for the user with the larger number of Twitter followers (24.3 +/- 14.4 versus 11.2 +/- 9.8, P = .015). A total of 57% of respondents agreed that radiologists' payments should shift to value-based payments, and 86% agreed that radiologists should routinely survey their patients to monitor quality; however, 83% disagreed with basing physician payments on patient satisfaction scores. A total of 85% disagreed that the artificial intelligence supercomputer Watson will entirely replace radiologists. A total of 76% agreed that social media can drive business at less cost than standard marketing. A total of 56% agreed with the direction of the ACR's advocacy and regulatory efforts, whereas 74% considered the ACR's advocacy efforts to be moderately or very useful for their practice. A total of 50% planned to change their practice on the basis of keynote remarks by Dr Ezekiel Emanuel. Conclusions: Twitter polls provide a free and easy infrastructure to potentially capture global public sentiment during the course of a medical society meeting. Their use may enrich and promote discussions of key session content.",

   "content": "Emulating the human brain is one of the core challenges of computational intelligence, which entails many key problems of artificial intelligence, including understanding human language, reasoning, and emotions. In this work, computational intelligence techniques are combined with common-sense computing and linguistics to analyze sentiment data flows, i.e., to automatically decode how humans express emotions and opinions via natural language. The increasing availability of social data is extremely beneficial for tasks such as branding, product positioning, corporate reputation management, and social media marketing. The elicitation of useful information from this huge amount of unstructured data, however, remains an open challenge. Although such data are easily accessible to humans, they are not suitable for automatic processing: machines are still unable to effectively and dynamically interpret the meaning associated with natural language text in very large, heterogeneous, noisy, and ambiguous environments such as the Web. We present a novel methodology that goes beyond mere word-level analysis of text and enables a more efficient transformation of unstructured social data into structured information, readily interpretable by machines. In particular, we describe a novel paradigm for real-time concept-level sentiment analysis that blends computational intelligence, linguistics, and common-sense computing in order to improve the accuracy of computationally expensive tasks such as polarity detection from big social data. The main novelty of the paper consists in an algorithm that assigns contextual polarity to concepts in text and flows this polarity through the dependency arcs in order to assign a final polarity label to each sentence. Analyzing how sentiment flows from concept to concept through dependency relations allows for a better understanding of the contextual role of each concept in text, to achieve a dynamic polarity inference that outperforms state-of-the-art statistical methods in terms of both accuracy and training time.",

   "content": "Purpose The main purpose of our study is to analyze the influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on firm performance, notably by building on the business value of AI-based transformation projects. This study was conducted using a four-step sequential approach: (1) analysis of AI and AI concepts/technologies; (2) in-depth exploration of case studies from a great number of industrial sectors; (3) data collection from the databases (websites) of AI-based solution providers; and (4) a review of AI literature to identify their impact on the performance of organizations while highlighting the business value of AI-enabled projects transformation within organizations. Design/methodology/approach This study has called on the theory of IT capabilities to seize the influence of AI business value on firm performance (at the organizational and process levels). The research process (responding to the research question, making discussions, interpretations and comparisons, and formulating recommendations) was based on a review of 500 case studies from IBM, AWS, Cloudera, Nvidia, Conversica, Universal Robots websites, etc. Studying the influence of AI on the performance of organizations, and more specifically, of the business value of such organizations' AI-enabled transformation projects, required us to make an archival data analysis following the three steps, namely the conceptual phase, the refinement and development phase, and the assessment phase. Findings AI covers a wide range of technologies, including machine translation, chatbots and self-learning algorithms, all of which can allow individuals to better understand their environment and act accordingly. Organizations have been adopting AI technological innovations with a view to adapting to or disrupting their ecosystem while developing and optimizing their strategic and competitive advantages. AI fully expresses its potential through its ability to optimize existing processes and improve automation, information and transformation effects, but also to detect, predict and interact with humans. Thus, the results of our study have highlighted such AI benefits in organizations, and more specifically, its ability to improve on performance at both the organizational (financial, marketing and administrative) and process levels. By building on these AI attributes, organizations can, therefore, enhance the business value of their transformed projects. The same results also showed that organizations achieve performance through AI capabilities only when they use their features/technologies to reconfigure their processes. Research limitations/implications AI obviously influences the way businesses are done today. Therefore, practitioners and researchers need to consider AI as a valuable support or even a pilot for a new business model. For the purpose of our study, we adopted a research framework geared toward a more inclusive and comprehensive approach so as to better account for the intangible benefits of AI within organizations. In terms of interest, this study nurtures a scientific interest, which aims at proposing a model for analyzing the influence of AI on the performance of organizations, and at the same time, filling the associated gap in the literature. As for the managerial interest, our study aims to provide managers with elements to be reconfigured or added in order to take advantage of the full benefits of AI, and therefore improve organizations' performance, the profitability of their investments in AI transformation projects, and some competitive advantage. This study also allows managers to consider AI not as a single technology but as a set/combination of several different configurations of IT in the various company's business areas because multiple key elements must be brought together to ensure the success of AI: data, talent mix, domain knowledge, key decisions, external partnerships and scalable infrastructure. Originality/value This article analyses case studies on the reuse of secondary data from AI deployment reports in organizations. The transformation of projects based on the use of AI focuses mainly on business process innovations and indirectly on those occurring at the organizational level. Thus, 500 case studies are being examined to provide significant and tangible evidence about the business value of AI-based projects and the impact of AI on firm performance. More specifically, this article, through these case studies, exposes the influence of AI at both the organizational and process performance levels, while considering it not as a single technology but as a set/combination of the several different configurations of IT in various industries.",

   "content": "Purpose The aim of this paper is to examine how money laundering occurs through electronic gaming devices, the regulatory requirements for operators of electronic gaming machines, the issues of on-line versus land-based gambling and a discussion about ethics and social responsibility. Design/methodology/approach This is primarily a conceptual paper which includes an identification of several theories relevant to money laundering. Primary data were obtained from one respondent through a face-to-face meeting and another through a telephone conversation. Findings A strong, globally co-ordinated effort is required to fight against the increasingly dark side of money laundering. The tenets of corporate social responsibility (CSR), including a strong focus on ethics, is vitally important in the gambling industry in helping to wipe out money laundering, which is used to make dirty money clean and in some instances, used to fund terrorism. Research limitations/implications Further studies could be conducted incorporating a sample of primary data within, and between, jurisdictions. Further work is recommended for developing a form of global collective targeted practical deterrents, supported by technology including artificial intelligence as identified to some degree in this paper. Whilst this paper has included a discussion on CSR, moral management and ethics as a means of arbitrating money laundering, future research could put this idea to the test. Practical implications Efforts (including technological) to combat money laundering at the venue level continue to be developed. Further, regulations could include mandatory training in CSR and ethics for all employees in organisations identified by regulators as being particularly susceptible to money laundering. Social implications Terrorist actions have gained increasing attention as various countries have had to endure seemingly escalating atrocities in their jurisdictions. Government has an important role to take the necessary steps to strike out terrorism to protect its citizens. Originality/value No peer-reviewed academic articles could be identified using a Google Scholar search on money laundering and/or marketing and or CSR. A limited number of articles were identified using the search terms money laundering and gambling.",

   "content": "Information technologies in general and artifical intelligence (AI) in particular try to shift operational task away from a human actor. Machine learning (ML) is a discipline within AI that deals with learning improvement based on data. Subsequently, retailing and wholesaling, which are known for their high proportion of human work and at the same time low profit margins, can be regarded as a natural fit for the application of AI and ML tools. This article examines the current prevalence of the use of machine learning in the industry. The paper uses two disparate approaches to identify the scientific and practical state-of-the-art within the domain: a literature review on the major scientific databases and an empirical study of the 10 largest international retail companies and their adoption of ML technologies in the domain are combined with each other. This text does not present a prototype using machine learning techniques. Instead of a consideration and comparison of the particular algorythms and approaches, the underling problems and operational tasks that are elementary for the specific domain are identified. Based on a comprehensive literature review the main problem types that ML can serve, and the associated ML techniques, are evaluated. An empirical study of the 10 largest retail companies and their ML adoption shows that the practical market adoption is highly variable. The pioneers have extensively integrated applications into everyday business, while others only show a small set of early prototypes. However, some others show neither active use nor efforts to apply such a technology. Following this, a structured approach is taken to analyze the value-adding core processes of retail companies. The current scientific and practical application scenarios and possibilities are illustrated in detail. In summary, there are numerous possible applications in all areas. In particular, in areas where future forecasts and predictions are needed (like marketing or replenishment), the use of ML today is both scientifically and practically highly developed.",

   "content": "One of the results of the evolution of business process management (BPM) is the development of information technology (IT), methodologies and software tools to manage all types of processes - from traditional, structured processes to unstructured processes, for which it is not possible to define a detailed flow as a sequence of tasks to be performed before implementation. The purpose of the article is to present the evolution of intelligent BPM systems (iBPMS) and dynamic case management/adaptive case management systems (DCMS/ACMS) and show that they converge into one class of systems, additionally absorbing new emerging technologies such as process mining, robotic process automation (RPA), or machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI). The content of research reports on iBPMS and DCMS systems by Gartner and Forrester consulting companies from the last 10 years was analysed. The nature of this study is descriptive and based solely on information from secondary data sources. It is an argumentative paper, and the study serves as the arguments that relate to the main research questions. The research results reveal that under business pressure, the evolution of both classes of systems (iBPMS and DCMS/ACMS) tends to cover the functionality of the same area of requirements by enabling the support of processes of different nature. This de facto means the creation of one class of systems, although for marketing reasons, some vendors will still offer separate products for some time to come. The article shows that the main driver of unified software system development is not the new possibilities offered by IT, but the requirements imposed on BPM by the increasingly stronger impact of knowledge management (KM) with regard to the way business processes are executed. Hence the anticipation of the further evolution of methodologies and BPM supporting systems towards integration with KM and elements of knowledge management systems (KMS). This article presents an original view on the features and development trends of software systems supporting BPM as a consequence of knowledge economy (KE) requirements in accordance with the concept of dynamic BPM.",

   "content": "Background: Atrial fibrillation is the most common persistent arrhythmia. It is associated with increased mortality and morbidity such as stroke. The early detection of atrial fibrillation can significantly reduce the risk of stroke through preventive anticoagulation. Smartwatches offer the opportunity to screen for atrial fibrillation in the general population. This paper aims to analyze the ethical challenges associated with screening for atrial fibrillation using smartwatches. Methods: This is an ethical analysis. The methodology is based on the principle-orientated approach of Beauchamp and Childress. The principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, and autonomy have to be guaranteed given the influence of private companies, privacy protection, liability and doctor-patient-relationship. The work is based on a systematic literature research. Results: There is currently no evidence that screening for atrial fibrillation with smartwatches improves the outcome and reduces the number of adverse events. The high number of false-positive results can lead to harm. The principle of non-maleficence is violated. The over-reliance on and the lack of adequate education by smartwatches can worsen the doctor-patient relationship. However, the relationship can also be improved by the proactive participation of the patient, which leads to greater autonomy, compliance and in the end beneficence. Since smartwatches are consumer goods, there is a risk for greater disparities in the poor and rich population. There is also a risk of discrimination against ethnic minorities due to underrepresentation in training data and study cohorts. The principle of justice is violated. The storage of sensitive medical data by private companies also raises many ethical and legal concerns. Conclusion: This analysis has shown that the use of smartwatches to detect atrial fibrillation is currently in an ethical perspective problematic. The lack of evidence and the high number of false-positive results can lead to harm. As smartwatches provide only little information about the possible consequences, informed consent cannot be assumed. Ethical implementation could be archived if doctors provide smartwatches to patients who have been shown to benefit from them. The implementation and education should be managed by the doctor.",

The article presents a semantic network which describes the model for developing CM design patterns. It identifies key network concepts: the software product, consumer properties, positioning strategy, potential consumers, consumer preferences, features of information perception, a unique proposal, message distribution tools. Associative links between concepts are described. Elements of a semantic network dictionary are offered: the object of definitions, the characteristics of objects, the semantic units of characteristics; semantic unit description of lexical construction dictionary elements - target, key, alternative. Target lexical constructions describe and specify the format of the advertising message in the template. Key lexical constructions determine unique characteristics of the objects' concept. Alternative lexical constructions are designed to strengthen the influence of semantic units and to exert additional impact on potential users. Communication message templates are combinations of semantic units with suggested messages that are most likely to motivate consumers to take certain actions. For practical approval of the use of templates for designing CM in product promotion to the corporate market, a multi-layered production semantic network has been developed. Network layer multiplicity matches a variety of concepts. Each layer consists of a set of objects that reflect the qualitative composition of the layer. The procedure for selecting variants of communication message templates is a non-cyclic chain of the semantic network using production rules. There are consistently selected elements: the representative of the target audience, the type of consumer behavior, the positioning strategy, the tool for disseminating communication messages, the structural element of communication messages. The results obtained can be useful for directors and managers of small IT companies in organizing Internet advertising of their products.",

   "content": "The fundamental purpose of a quality control programme is to acquire dependable information on all the attributes of a product, which affects its quality. In conditions of modem open society the protection of rights and interests of consumers, and a possibility of free exchange of information on the quality of products and changes of their properties during production, marketing, storing, and consumption have special significance. The law On Protection of Consumers' Rights forms the basis of such system of consumers' interests and rights protection in Latvia. In different states various forms of mechanisms for the protection of consumers' interests exist, corresponding to the Main principles for the Protection of Consumers' Interests of the United Nation Organisation. These principles provide the necessity of maintenance of physical reliability of the goods to guarantee consumers' safety, protection of consumers' economic interests, development of the goods and services standards, and indemnification of the consumers' losses. Now seven basic rights of the consumers are accepted in the world practice. Agricultural products have to conform to a set minimum standard established by the industry. These standards are commonly referred to as commodity standards or standards of identity. The methods used to measure quality can be subjective as in taste tests, or they can be objective, such as physical, chemical or microscopic analysis. Subjective methods are based on the opinions of the examiners, and since they require the use of our various senses, they are often called sensory analysis. The first type is legal standards - those which are commonly established by national governments and generally relate to safety. These standards are often mandatory and represent minimum standards of quality. At the modelling of the biotechnical systems, sensation can be interpreted by elements of intelligent technologies, for example, using artificial intelligence (AI): by artificial bodies of feelings (gauges, sensors), by smell (artificial nose), by artificial sight (machine vision systems of the technical sight), by artificial vote (sound), artificial hearing (ear), acoustical, vibrating, and by other AI sensor elements. Qualitative peculiarity of this or that sensations name them modality. The measurement and evaluation of quality is a complicated measure. However, it did not prove to be very reliable, and almost all firms now use various analytical methods for the quality determinations. In a highly-competitive market, other criteria of quality can be value or a consumer's perception of the worth of the product based upon the funds available for it. Many studies have been done in order to find new and more diverse sensors, and to date there are several companies offering ready-to-use electronic tongue. For ages, the human tongue has been an important tool in assessing the quality of many products, food and agricultural products being good examples. While all other parts of production processes, including these of the food industry, were getting more and more automated, there were still no objective means for using the subjective information confined in the taste of products. The main research results are reflected in the article. On the basis of elaborated structural-function model of the main relations, responsibility and communications between consumers, state and manufacturers, and results of the previous experimental researches the authors have developed a new intelligent bar-code concept for the protection of consumers. The new intelligent consumers' protection technology is based on the free possibility for each consumer to use bar-code of goods together with special intelligent instruments and computer technologies for the goods conformity assessment directly in the food market or in other trade room.",

Having undergone rapid growth over the past 2 decades, PV now touches many other disciplines in the research and development enterprise. With its growth has come a heightened awareness and interest in the medical community about the roles that PV plays. This article provides insights into the background and inner workings of PV. Methods: This narrative review covers the core PV activities and other major areas of the pharmaceutical enterprise in which PV makes significant contributions. Findings: Drug safety monitoring activities were organized by the US Food and Drug Administration and academic medical centers in the early 1950s in response to growing concern over the occurrence of aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias associated with the use of chloramphenicol. This experience was codified in the 1962 Kefauver-Harris Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act as adverse event evaluation and reporting requirements. The ensuing decades have seen the development of core PV functions for pharmaceutical companies: case management, signal management, and benefit-risk management. A broader scope of PV has developed to include the following major activities: support of patient safety during the conduct of clinical trials through assuring proper use of informed consent and institutional review boards (ethics committees); selection of the first safe dose for use in humans, based on pharmacologic data obtained in animal studies; development of the safety profile for proper use of a new molecular entity and appropriate communication of that information to the range of relevant stakeholders; attendance to surveillance activities through a set of signal management processes; monitoring the manufactured product itself through collaborative activities with manufacturing professionals; management of benefit risk to assure appropriate use in medical care after marketing; and maintenance of inspection readiness as a corporate cultural process. Implications: The extent and pace of change promise to accelerate with the integration of biomedical informatics, analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. This progress has implications for the development of the next generation of PV professionals who will need to be trained in entirely new skill sets to lead continued improvements in the safe use of pharmaceuticals.

The above damage monitoring approach is not based on electrical continuity and hence can be applied to any electronic assembly structure irrespective of the interconnections. The damage index developed provides parametric damage progression data, thus removing the limitation of current failure testing, where the damage progression cannot be monitored.

   "content": "Machine-learning algorithms are transforming large segments of the economy as they fuel innovation in search engines, self-driving cars, product marketing, and medical imaging, among many other technologies. As machine learning's use expands across all facets of society, anxiety has emerged about the intrusion of algorithmic machines into facets of life previously dependent on human judgment. Alarm bells sounding over the diffusion of artificial intelligence throughout the private sector only portend greater anxiety about digital robots replacing humans in the governmental sphere. A few administrative agencies have already begun to adopt this technology, while others have clear potential in the near term to use algorithms to shape official decisions over both rulemaking and adjudication. It is no longer fanciful to envision a future in which government agencies could effectively make law by robot, a prospect that understandably conjures up dystopian images of individuals surrendering their liberty to the control of computerized overlords. Should society be alarmed by governmental use of machine-learning applications? We examine this question by considering whether the use of robotic decision tools by government agencies can pass muster under core, time-honored doctrines of administrative and constitutional law At first glance, the idea of algorithmic regulation might appear to offend one or more traditional doctrines, such as the nondelegation doctrine, procedural due process, equal protection, or principles of reason-giving and transparency. We conclude, however, that when machine-learning technology is properly understood, its use by government agencies can comfortably fit within these conventional legal parameters. We recognize, of course, that the legality of regulation by robot is only one criterion by which its use should be assessed. Agencies should not apply algorithms cavalierly, even if doing so might not run afoul of the law; in some cases, safeguards may be needed for machine learning to satisfy broader, good-governance aspirations. Yet, in contrast with the emerging alarmism, we resist any categorical dismissal of a future administrative state in which algorithmic automation guides, and even at times makes, key decisions. Instead, we urge that governmental reliance on machine learning should be approached with measured optimism about the potential benefits such technology can offer society by making government smarter and its decisions more efficient and just.",

   "content": "The aim of the article is to present how and with what consequences the dynamic development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) affects the transformation of the work of contemporary managers. In accomplishing this goal, the essence and explanation of the specificity of the managerial profession were presented to confront traditional expectations addressed to managers with expectations resulting from the development of the digital economy. ICT was presented as General Purpose Technologies (GPT), which led to the third technological revolution. Next, new ICT solutions are synthetically presented, which currently have a particularly strong impact on the work of managers, their decisions and the strategies and management methods they adopt. The main attention was paid to such solutions as mobile and wireless technologies, Big Data, Cloud Computing, Internet of Things and 3D printing technology. The importance of ICT power resulting from their range and universality of the application was also emphasized and it was also indicated that such solutions as artificial intelligence, supercomputer, autonomous cars, robots, bitcoins and blockchains and neurotechnologies are also interesting. Next, an attempt was made to explain how the expectations addressed to contemporary managers change. It was pointed out that currently, managers need to revise the existing, traditional management methods. At the same time, new approaches to management should apply to virtually all dimensions of their activity and responsibility. Fundamental changes should include, among others, organization strategy, shaping organizational structures, human resources management practices, marketing, managing people and managing teams. As a consequence, managers should be able to implement new business models. As it results from the analysis, the managers' approach to the tasks they fulfill should change fundamentally. In the conditions of the digital economy, they should be ready to give up some of their power and link the organization's success with work within flattened organizational structures. In a new way, they also have to approach the implementation of organizational leadership and team management. The paper is an attempt to implement the prognostic goals of management theory and practice. It is based on a critical analysis of available, very extensive literature on the subject in the area covered by the topic. It also used the analysis of statistical data on ICT development and the results of querying reports and thematic studies of well-known consulting companies. Also included are business case studies published in reputable business journals, which particularly use ICT effectively.",

   "content": "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyze competitive strategies implemented by two Iranian taxi service mobile apps - Snapp and Tap30 - in different domains by using the modified version of the generic strategies proposed by Porter and focusing on the online taxi market. Design/methodology/approach Due to the in-depth nature of competitive strategies in ridesharing platforms, the study employs comparative case research to understand the dynamics of such businesses in terms of developing mobile applications. By comparatively investigating competitive strategies of two Iranian mobile apps in ridesharing business, it is possible to extract rich knowledge about the commonalities between cases and the specificities of each of them to reach success in this market. Findings Although Snapp has made significant efforts to provide various services to passengers, the findings show that it has not been able to do it intelligently, as it has failed to identify customers' new needs. In addition, Snapp is trying to keep its position in the Iranian market by monopolizing it. On the contrary, Tap30 has paid attention to the intelligence of services in order to explore and exploit new opportunities, so that it can be distinguished from its rival and gain competitive advantage. The proper and timely use of artificial intelligence by these apps will be a major issue that will greatly determine their future success on the market, according to the conclusion of this work. Research limitations/implications Like other qualitative researches, this study also has limitations in generalizing findings to other communities. For this purpose, it is recommended that the results of this study be generalized more cautiously. Moreover, access to some data in the digital market of Iran was one of the significant issues that researchers faced with. However, using a large number of different databases, attempts were made to reduce such limitations. Practical implications Applying the competitive strategies introduced in the present research, platform managers would be benefited from using the insights provided here. In particular, they should understand the fact that competitive advantages are deeply tied to a combination of product/service differentiation, costs leadership and marketing strategies rather than focusing on just one dimension. Originality/value Focusing on the strategy literature, the paper contributes to business debates on ridesharing platforms, especially in an emerging market, Iran. This study also moves digital entrepreneurship literature forward in online taxi services by shedding light on their competitive strategies in an emerging economy.",

   "content": "As product life cycles become shorter and market demands for new products increase, the producing companies face a strong challenge to reorganize their development and manufacturing processes. Thus new strategies are required. Simultaneous Engineering (SE) or Concur-rent Engineering (CE) is the current approach to meet the new demands. Integrated development and production management is the strategic objective. The consistent persecution of this objective enforces the replacement of traditional department specific division of labour, which was invented by Taylor, by cooperative enterprise-wide problem solving. This paper analyses the current approaches of research and application of CE-principles. A specific definition of Concurrent Engineering will lead to the view upon CE from a blackboard-dominated perspective. The key element of CE is the synchronization of concurrent tasks in a development project. Synchronization means to equalize object oriented and process oriented decisions. All the different enterprise-wide functions as marketing, design, planning, cost accounting, quality assurance distribution, and more, have to bring to bear their recommendation, restrictions, and interests at the different product life cycle stages simultaneously. The first and mostly applied step on the road to CE is to build up cross-functional project teams, which work as synchronization institutions. A lot of examples out of industry show, that this approach leads to significant benefits in time and cost. Problem solving in human teams has a technical, but a social and philosophical dimension as well. It covers the basic principles of dialectic invented by Sokrates and Platon. The readiness and willingness to contribute with own theses, to discuss and redefine them, have to be taken into account. The development of new computer systems produces several principles for concurrent problem solving. Multiprocessor units in the hardware area and object-oriented programming, reason maintenance systems and constraints in a knowledge based software environment are some of the main issues to be mentioned. New possibilities comming out of advanced network technology enables project teams to cooperate even in distributed locations. To exploit the benefits of the team approach and information technology the potentials of the blackboard-principle will be discussed. In a blackboard system a set of processes, typically called knowledge sources, shares a common database or blackboard of symbolic structures, often called hypotheses. Each knowledge source is an expert in its specific function like,design, manufacturing, or quality control. Each expert may find a hypothesis he can work on, solve it, create new hypotheses, and modify other existing hypotheses. The set of processes corporates by sharing the common blackboard like a group of experts who incorporate the various life cycle perspectives to their product in a balanced manner. The main problem of applying the blackboard principle to CE is the control of the blackboard itself. A CE-specific logical level has to be developed before system implementation begins. The paper will discuss some basic strategies to activate and control the distributed knowledge sources.",

   "content": "Purpose Retail networks present new challenges in the business-to-business (B2B) collaboration between technology-based spinoffs and traditional businesses. This study aims to explore a public-private partnership (PPP) that leverages advanced digital technologies via spinoffs to tackle the key challenge of showrooming that retail shops are facing. Showrooming is the phenomenon in which shoppers go to the physical stores to gather in-depth product information, and later on, decide to buy the product from online retail competitors. Design/methodology/approach This research draws on a longitudinal qualitative study of a social context in which digital entrepreneurs are embedded. The empirical setting is a retail network in Italy, Germany and Finland with a particular focus on the process in which a PPP delivers innovation via spinoffs in the context of brick and mortar shops (B&M). The research design enables an understanding of the complexity of the phenomenon from a business and a social perspective. Findings New technology to tackle showrooming enables the creation of substantial hybrid value in retail partnerships. Spinoffs are key actors in leveraging digital technologies to create value faster and more tailored compared with large software companies. Spinoff entrepreneurs leverage on specific technologies (e.g. virtual reality and artificial intelligence) available inside organizations' network (i.e. PPPs). Spinoffs are found to be a fundamental actor in the process of dealing with showrooming because of their time to market. Large software companies usually are not interested in approaching B&M shops because of the high operational costs of product customization for B&M shops. Practical implications Managers could use the success factors of the spinoffs in helping their B&M shops to improve both shopper experience and salesperson performance. For managers of B2B retail network, the results are useful towards increasing the involvement of shoppers while they are visiting physical stores, and it also improves salesperson performance. It also leads to the observation that cross-selling is one of the most effective responses to the phenomenon of showrooming. As practical implications for policymakers, the current research supports the view that PPPs should support the creation of spinoffs as a result of longitudinal innovation projects. Social implications Retail technologies leveraged from a PPP and commercialized by spinoffs are powerful tools to enable a better quality of salespeople's life in the working place. At the same time, these new technologies help shop owners increase the retention rates, conversion rates and reduce short-term loss, increasing the likelihood of B&M shops to survive in the condition of extreme competition caused by the showrooming phenomenon. Originality/value This research proposes a model of hybrid value creation from networks in digital retail. The model indicates that PPPs create spinoffs to explore showrooming and deliver substantial hybrid value (i.e. business and social) for physical retail shops, mainly because it influences the companies' growth, employee performance and customer satisfaction. This model expands the field of B2B marketing by identifying factors that enable spinoff creation from retail networks and proposes success factors and research propositions in retail networks.",

   "content": "Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to determine the best approach to customer segmentation and to extrapolate associated rules for this based on recency, frequency and monetary (RFM) considerations as well as demographic factors. In this study, the impacts of RFM and demographic attributes have been challenged in order to enrich factors that lend comprehension to customer segmentation. Different types of scenario were designed, performed and evaluated meticulously under uniform test conditions. The data for this study were extracted from the database of a global pizza restaurant chain in Turkey. This paper summarizes the findings of the study and also provides evidence of its empirical implications to improve the performance of customer segmentation as well as achieving extracted rule perfection via effective model factors and variations. Accordingly, marketing and service processes will work more effectively and efficiently for customers and society. The implication of this study is that it explains a clear concept for interaction between producers and consumers. Design/methodology/approach - Customer relationship management, which aims to manage record and evaluate customer interactions, is generally regarded as a vital tool for companies that wish to be successful in the rapidly changing global market. The prediction of customer behaviors is a strategically important and difficult issue because of the high variance and wide range of customer orders and preferences. So to have an effective tool for extracting rules based on customer purchasing behavior, considering tangible and intangible criteria is highly important. To overcome the challenges imposed by the multifaceted nature of this problem, the authors utilized artificial intelligence methods, including k-means clustering, Apriori association rule mining (ARM) and neural networks. The main idea was that customer clusters are better enhanced when segmentation processes are based on RFM analysis accompanied by demographic data. Weighted RFM (WRFM) and unweighted RFM values/scores were applied with and without demographic factors and utilized to compose different types and numbers of clusters. The Apriori algorithm was used to extract rules of association. The performance analyses of scenarios have been conducted based on these extracted rules. The number of rules, elapsed time and prediction accuracy were used to evaluate the different scenarios. The results of evaluations were compared with the outputs of another available technique. Findings - The results showed that having an appropriate segmentation approach is vital if there are to be strong association rules. Also, it has been determined from the results that the weights of RFM attributes affect rule association performance positively. Moreover, to capture more accurate customer segments, a combination of RFM and demographic attributes is recommended for clustering. The results' analyses indicate the undeniable importance of demographic data merged with WRFM. Above all, this challenge introduced the best possible sequence of factors for an analysis of clustering and ARM based on RFM and demographic data. Originality/value - The work compared k-means and Kohonen clustering methods in its segmentation phase to prove the superiority of adopted segmentation techniques. In addition, this study indicated that customer segments containing WRFM scores and demographic data in the same clusters brought about stronger and more accurate association rules for the understanding of customer behavior. These so-called achievements were compared with the results of classical approaches in order to support the credibility of the proposed methodology. Based on previous works, classical methods for customer segmentation have overlooked any combination of demographic data with WRFM during clustering before proceeding to their rule extraction stages.",

   "content": "Chapter 1: How Australia improved health equity through action on the social determinants of health Do not think that the social determinants of health equity are old hat. In reality, Australia is very far away from addressing the societal level drivers of health inequity. There is little progressive policy that touches on the conditions of daily life that matter for health, and action to redress inequities in power, money and resources is almost non-existent. In this chapter we ask you to pause this reality and come on a fantastic journey where we envisage how COVID-19 was a great disruptor and accelerator of positive progressive action. We offer glimmers of what life could be like if there was committed and real policy action on the social determinants of health equity. It is vital that the health sector assists in convening the multisectoral stakeholders necessary to turn this fantasy into reality. Chapter 2: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander connection to culture: building stronger individual and collective wellbeing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have long maintained that culture (ie, practising, maintaining and reclaiming it) is vital to good health and wellbeing. However, this knowledge and understanding has been dismissed or described as anecdotal or intangible by Western research methods and science. As a result, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture is a poorly acknowledged determinant of health and wellbeing, despite its significant role in shaping individuals, communities and societies. By extension, the cultural determinants of health have been poorly defined until recently. However, an increasing amount of scientific evidence supports what Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have always said - that strong culture plays a significant and positive role in improved health and wellbeing. Owing to known gaps in knowledge, we aim to define the cultural determinants of health and describe their relationship with the social determinants of health, to provide a full understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander wellbeing. We provide examples of evidence on cultural determinants of health and links to improved Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health and wellbeing. We also discuss future research directions that will enable a deeper understanding of the cultural determinants of health for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Chapter 3: Physical determinants of health: healthy, liveable and sustainable communities Good city planning is essential for protecting and improving human and planetary health. Until recently, however, collaboration between city planners and the public health sector has languished. We review the evidence on the health benefits of good city planning and propose an agenda for public health advocacy relating to health-promoting city planning for all by 2030. Over the next 10 years, there is an urgent need for public health leaders to collaborate with city planners - to advocate for evidence-informed policy, and to evaluate the health effects of city planning efforts. Importantly, we need integrated planning across and between all levels of government and sectors, to create healthy, liveable and sustainable cities for all. Chapter 4: Health promotion in the Anthropocene: the ecological determinants of health Human health is inextricably linked to the health of the natural environment. In this chapter, we focus on ecological determinants of health, including the urgent and critical threats to the natural environment, and opportunities for health promotion arising from the human health co-benefits of actions to protect the health of the planet. We characterise ecological determinants in the Anthropocene and provide a sobering snapshot of planetary health science, particularly the momentous climate change health impacts in Australia. We highlight Australia's position as a major fossil fuel producer and exporter, and a country lacking cohesive and timely emissions reduction policy. We offer a roadmap for action, with four priority directions, and point to a scaffold of guiding approaches - planetary health, Indigenous people's knowledge systems, ecological economics, health co-benefits and climate-resilient development. Our situation requires a paradigm shift, and this demands a recalibration of health promotion education, research and practice in Australia over the coming decade. Chapter 5: Disrupting the commercial determinants of health Our vision for 2030 is an Australian economy that promotes optimal human and planetary health for current and future generations. To achieve this, current patterns of corporate practice and consumption of harmful commodities and services need to change. In this chapter, we suggest ways forward for Australia, focusing on pragmatic actions that can be taken now to redress the power imbalances between corporations and Australian governments and citizens. We begin by exploring how the terms of health policy making must change to protect it from conflicted commercial interests. We also examine how marketing unhealthy products and services can be more effectively regulated, and how healthier business practices can be incentivised. Finally, we make recommendations on how various public health stakeholders can hold corporations to account, to ensure that people come before profits in a healthy and prosperous future Australia. Chapter 6: Digital determinants of health: the digital transformation We live in an age of rapid and exponential technological change. Extraordinary digital advancements and the fusion of technologies, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things and quantum computing constitute what is often referred to as the digital revolution or the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0). Reflections on the future of public health and health promotion require thorough consideration of the role of digital technologies and the systems they influence. Just how the digital revolution will unfold is unknown, but it is clear that advancements and integrations of technologies will fundamentally influence our health and wellbeing in the future. The public health response must be proactive, involving many stakeholders, and thoughtfully considered to ensure equitable and ethical applications and use. Chapter 7: Governance for health and equity: a vision for our future Coronavirus disease 2019 has caused many people and communities to take stock on Australia's direction in relation to health, community, jobs, environmental sustainability, income and wealth. A desire for change is in the air. This chapter imagines how changes in the way we govern our lives and what we value as a society could solve many of the issues Australia is facing - most pressingly, the climate crisis and growing economic and health inequities. We present an imagined future for 2030 where governance structures are designed to ensure transparent and fair behaviour from those in power and to increase the involvement of citizens in these decisions, including a constitutional voice for Indigenous peoples. We imagine that these changes were made by measuring social progress in new ways, ensuring taxation for public good, enshrining human rights (including to health) in legislation, and protecting and encouraging an independent media. Measures to overcome the climate crisis were adopted and democratic processes introduced in the provision of housing, education and community development.",
